The words we speak are electromagnetic forces that usually reflect our inner attitude.  \n \nThey contain the power of death and life and ultimately influence the world around us. Augustus Woodbury once said, “Scientific men tell us that every sound upon the surface of our own and other planets circulates in endless and ceaseless waves through infinite space. Certainly not less subtle is the influence of our words upon the life and character of the world.” We must always think about the influence of our words before we say them out; “what is my objective in saying this.” “Are these words going to produce life or death.” Proverbs 18:21 declares, “Death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit.” \n \n\nAs a matter of fact, words are our input in someone else’s life. We must make sure our input gives life and not death. We are actually responsible for the impact we have on others and our communities in general. \n \nAs responsible citizens, we must intensify our awareness of the input we have on other people’s lives. Actually, one person can change the course of another person’s life with the power of words. Individual dreams and visions have been aborted because of words of death spoken over them. Homes and marriages have been destroyed because of poisonous words. Companies and businesses have fallen because of words of envy and jealousy. People have lost their jobs because of lying words said about them. We should always be conscious of the life-changing power of our words. \n \n\nProverbs 19:1 says, “Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.” We must use wisdom when we speak, by checking our motives, attitudes and choice of words. We must divorce negative patterns of thinking and bring life to others with our words. Words are influencers. One of the best ways we can use words to influence others, is to practice telling the truth. \n \nWe are living in the world where too often people try to influence others with manipulation, false flattery and deception and spin doctoring. The truth creates trust, which in turn generates influence. The other way we can put our words to good use, is to choose to use words that build in our speech, rather than words that tear down people and society. \n \n\nWe should use our words to build other people up, to inspire, encourage and empower, to affirm and bless. Positive words yield positive influence. It is wisdom to refuse to speak words that belittle and demoralise other people around us. When we make a choice of speaking well of others, in-spite of their short comings, then we will have a healthy and far reaching positive influence with our words. \n \nIf we spread malicious gossip, we are poisoning our own future and sabotaging our own influence with others. King Solomon of ancient Israel said, “When a leader listens to malicious gossip, all the workers get infested with evil” (Proverbs 29:12, the message Bible). We must use the influence of our words to bring peace in conflicting situations. \n \n\nDue to the fact that many people have no understanding of the power of their words, they have caused themselves and others unnecessary pain and hardships. Each and every day our actions and our words impact those around us. \n \nThe question is, how are we influencing others with our words and actions? One of the best ways we can influence each other is by inspiring, motivating and encouraging each other by what we say. The story is told about how Sugar Ray Robinson changed the course of one girl’s life, Flo-Jo. \n \nWhen narrating her life story Flo-Jo said, “Sugar Ray looked at me in the eye and told me, it doesn’t matter where you come from, what the colour of your skin is, or what odds are against you. All that matters is that you have a dream and you commit yourself to that dream. Do that and it will happen.” She continued and said, “Right then and there, I was sold out. I was just eight years old but I was fired up about what my future could be.” \n \n\nWith words, Sugar Ray Robinson, one of the outstanding boxing champs inspired a great change in one girls’ life. Words are powerful, they can inspire those around us to greatness. They can bring hope to the hopeless, courage to the discouraged, comfort and healing to the oppressed. We must speak life to our husbands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, our communities and nation. \n \nPaul’s wise advice to the Ephesians is appropriate at this juncture, “Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.” (Ephesians 4:29). By our words we can build the nation and by our words we can destroy the nation.
c5f8a528-cc0f-4f3e-aaef-b9e3b6b00325	Tony Abbott's last word  \nWatch the last press conference of outgoing Prime Minister Tony Abbott in full. \n PT6M11S   620  349    \n\nThey're the power couple who have run the Liberal Party back-room operation since December 2009. \n\nBut Tony Abbott's ousting as prime minister will inevitably lead to his high-profile chief of staff, Peta Credlin, quitting the blue carpet in Parliament House's ministerial wing. \n \nPeta Credlin and Brian Loughnane arrive for the Midwinter Ball at Parliament House in June. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nWhat will happen to her husband, long-serving Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, is less clear. \n \nMs Credlin worked for Malcolm Turnbull during his stint as opposition leader in 2008-09, but the pair did not always see eye to eye and she will not be working for the incoming leader. \n\nAfter her time with Mr Turnbull, Ms Credlin became the dominant figure in the Abbott government, described as a controlling co-prime minister by her critics, lauded by her allies — not least Mr Abbott, who called her the "fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with".  As chief of staff, she became one of the most high-profile staffers in recent political history. \n \nFrom the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Peta Credlin was in the room as one of his most trusted lieutenants. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nFrom the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Ms Credlin was in the room as one of the opposition leader's most trusted lieutenants alongside press secretaries and advisers Andrew Hirst and Claire Kimball, honing and refining Mr Abbott's laser-like attack on Kevin Rudd's carbon pollution reduction scheme. \n\nAfter just less than four years in opposition,  in September 2013, Ms Credlin, a lawyer with years of experience in the Howard government, made the transition as chief of staff into government. \n\nBut the tightly controlled approach adopted in opposition did not work as smoothly in government. \n \nMr Abbott and Ms Credlin in 2013. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nPublic complaints about a " command and control " approach taken by the prime minister's office quickly surfaced, and a reliance on slogans that worked in opposition did not cut through in government. \n\nIn February 2015, when Mr Abbott faced a spill motion in the party room, some MPs were calling for a shake-up of the prime minister's office, and for political veteran Tony Nutt to be brought into the office. \n\nMs Credlin disappeared from public view, for a time, but the complaints soon resurfaced. \n \nBrian Loughnane has been federal director of the Liberal Party since 2003. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nBut Mr Abbott refused suggestions of change to his office: in his farewell speech, he singled out his chief of staff  "who has been unfairly maligned by people who should've known better". \n\nAnd now, both exit the political centre stage, at least for a time. \n\nMr Loughnane, meanwhile, has been federal director of the Liberal Party since February 2003 and party strategists told Fairfax Media on Tuesday that, if possible, he should continue in the role. \n\nOne veteran pointed out that Mr Turnbull and Mr Loughnane had worked together before, during Mr Turnbull's stint as opposition leader, and that a change in director was not "necessary or inevitable". \n\nThat veteran also said the prime minister's office would likely benefit from a bit of "competitive tension" between it and Liberal Party HQ. \n\n"It depends on the relationship between the two of them; [Mr Loughnane] has served every leader since Howard.      But Malcolm will have to be comfortable with the director – you can't have a situation like [former prime minister] Paul Keating and [former ALP secretary] Gary Gray [in 1996]." \n\nA second Liberal veteran said Ms Credlin was "very talented and a good manager, but it will be hard for her to stay in the show. I do hope Brian stays on. The most important thing is corporate knowledge and experience." \n\nFairfax Media sought comment from Ms Credlin and Mr Loughnane. \n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Turnbull also began the process of putting together his office team. \n\nThe former secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, and of the Communications Department, Drew Clarke, will serve as his acting chief of staff, while Mr Nutt, who worked closely with Turnbull backer Senator Arthur Sinodinos in the office of John Howard, will return to Canberra to help manage the transition to the prime ministership. \n\nSenator Sinodinos confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Turnbull would seek to emulate the attitude of Mr Howard as prime minister by taking a team approach, "and have a number of senior people in there who can provide advice and make sure it's an open prime minister's office, it's accessible and that there are tributaries of advice going to the prime minister," he told Sky News. \n\n"The role of the office is not to be a gatekeeper and cut people off; the role of the office has to be a facilitator of contact so the prime minister knows and has early warning of whether there are concerns. \n\n"You don't need the polls if you have backbenchers who are frank and willing to tell you what is going on." \n\nFollow James Massola on Facebook . \n\nFollow us on Twitter
0d07e617-00d4-4866-aee2-0ae197ae366f	WASHINGTON, Sept. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Each year, PhRMA and other biopharmaceutical industry leaders honor those who have made a significant contribution to the health care field. The Research and Hope Awards recognize the men and women conducting groundbreaking research, giving back to their community, advocating for patients and bringing awareness to particular diseases. This year, the awards honored those who are changing the world of oncology research and care. As we continue to gain new insight into the many variations of cancer, new tools are created, medicines are developed and new treatments emerge. With the help of dedicated individuals like the 2015 Research and Hope honorees, we move a little bit closer to transforming once-devastating diseases into manageable conditions.\n\nhttps://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150915/266923\n\nThis year's recipient of the Excellence in Biopharmaceutical Research award was the KEYTRUDA Team from Merck & Co., Inc. This team developed an approved treatment for advanced melanoma and it has the potential to treat many other types of cancer. We look forward to seeing the continued development of their breakthrough work.\n\nJ. Silvio Gutkind, Ph.D., professor, Department of Pharmacology; associate director, Basic Science, Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, is this year's recipient of the award for Excellence in Academic or Governmental Research. His extensive work with G proteins ultimately led to novel strategies for treating and preventing many types of cancer. These advances have the potential to save the lives of many patients in years to come.\n\nThe Community Champion Award went to Rick Dunetz, executive director and founder of the Side-Out Foundation. Rick, a local volleyball coach, invited his mother to work with his team after her breast cancer diagnosis. She found hope in their victories and the team was inspired to win not only for themselves, but for her as well. After seeing the transformation of his mother and his team, Rick founded the Side-Out Foundation to reach other athletes and cancer patients. His work is bringing hope and energy to the cause of ending breast cancer.\n\nVicki Kennedy, co-founder and president of the Board of the ; senior counsel, Greenberg Traurig LLP, was this year's recipient of the Award for Excellence in Advocacy and Activism. Since the passing of her late husband, Senator Ted Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy has spoken publicly on coping with stress and enhancing quality of life for brain tumor patients and their loved ones. Her dedication to telling her story, and the story of thousands of other families whose lives have been impacted by cancer is inspiring to many.\n\nThe recipients of the Visibility and Progress Award are Liz and Jay Scott, co-founders of Alex's Lemonade Stand. In 2000, their four-year-old daughter, Alex, founded Alex's Lemonade Stand to raise money to find a cure for childhood cancer after her own diagnosis. Following Alex's death in 2004, her parents set up the foundation to continue her dream of finding a cure. Since Alex's first stand in 2000, the foundation has raised more than $100 million to fund more than 475 cutting-edge research projects. Alex's spirit of determination and hope lives on through the foundations work.\n\nThese five awardees are just a few of the individuals doing outstanding work in the field of oncology research. With their dedication and our continued commitment to finding a cure, the future for cancer patients and their families looks a little bit brighter. To read more about this exciting progress, take a look at some of the honoree's response to the latest Conversations question: What are you most excited about in the fight against cancer?\n\nOn behalf of PhRMA and the co-sponsors of the 2015 Research and Hope Awards, we thank you for your contributions to this important effort.\n\nThe following organizations authored this post: ., American Lung Association, Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network (BCAN), CancerCare, Cancer Support Community, Chris4Life Colon Cancer Foundation, Friends of Cancer Research, No Stomach For Cancer, The Sarcoma Foundation of America\n\nContact: Andrew Powaleny; 202-835-3460; newsroom@phrma.org \n\nhttp://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20091027/PHRMALOGO\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150915/266923 \n\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20091027/PHRMALOGO \n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thanking-research-and-hope-honorees-for-their-efforts-fighting-cancer-300144093.html SOURCE
ebcd41ea-e5b4-43a4-9e16-4406d81cfcda	Have you ever felt like trading in the politically correct strictures of the mordern office for the world of Mad Men? Have you ever felt like trading in the politically correct strictures of our modern day office environment for the world of Mad Men? It still exists, apparently, if you are a Melbourne barrister.\n\nThat was the gist of a very non-PC marketing campaign by the trouble-prone financial services shop, IOOF.\n\nA male adviser at its subsidiary, Shadforth Financial Group, sent the email soliciting for financial planning business from Melbourne's barrister community.\n\nAccording to an article in Lawyers Weekly, it had a very specific idea about who our "typical barrister" is. Let's just say that the girls and boys have very specific roles.\n\nAccording to the article, "After marrying their 'school sweetheart' in their 30s, he suggested barristers in their 40s are likely to find themselves in the following position – 'Your wife is a 'home engineer', managing two children under 10, and you are finding the 'cottage' which was never quite finished is becoming a little crowded'."\n\nThings are better by the time this archetypal barrister hits his 50s. His career is established and "your wife has gone back to part-time work and the money flow is good for a while".\n\nThe report said several barristers had complained about this stereotype of a very male Bar with stay-at-home wives.\n\n"Are we not thrust back to the beginnings of Mad Men?" an anonymous QC told the publication.\n\nA Shadforth​ spokesperson told Lawyers Weekly: "This does not reflect the view of Shadforth​ and is not the Shadforth​ way."\n\nIt won't be help Shadforth's​ parent, IOOF, which needs all the legal help it can get. The ASX-listed company has faced a Senate grilling, and an investigation from ASIC over allegations of front running, insider trading and faulty research reports. Degree of pain \n\nCBD would like to admit that we might have been a tad unappreciative of just what the Hawke-Keating era minister, John Dawkins, achieved during his all-too brief stint chairing education dunce, Vocation.\n\nMuch has been written about the disastrous unravelling of its business, and carnage for investors who were flogged the stock at more than $3 a pop. It is now worth 10¢.\n\nGood thing they have the luxury of three different class actions at their disposal.\n\nBut they should have known better. The risks were all reported in the previous annual report signed by Dawkins, according to his replacement in the chair, Doug Halley.\n\nIn this year's report, Halley referred to last year's effort saying: "Our annual report also referred to risks that might restrict Vocation's ability to deliver on its strategy. With hindsight, two of these risks – the company's dependence on the support of government funding, and damage to its brand – were prescient."\n\nThat is one way of putting it.\n\nThere is some good news for investors. The new chief executive, Stewart Cummins, said he plans new initiatives to get the company back on track like, "build a strong management team" and upgrade its systems "to provide accurate management information".\n\nWow, why didn't they think of this before the IPO in December 2013.\n\nThe most sobering information is that the company paid out a $9.5 million dividend pre IPO, and another $6.5 million in 2014.\n\nThat is $16 million in cash dividends for a company now worth $23 million. NAB's Poach \n\nASIC's national media manager, Andre Khoury, will be playing on the other side of the fence, taking up a position with NAB next month.\n\nBut NAB confirmed that he will not be working with its wealth boss, Andrew Hagger.\n\nIt is an important point given Hagger has been moonlighting for ASIC thanks to the bank's wealth fiasco.\n\nIn March this year, a Senate committee heard how Hagger has had to check no fewer than five ASIC media releases that had been sent to the bank in draft form.\n\n"Our practice of sending media releases to external entities has been that, with a negotiated outcome – and only with a negotiated outcome such as an Enforceable Undertaking – ASIC will generally provide the party with our media release shortly ahead of publication," explained Khoury's current boss, Greg Medcraft​. Fat loss\n\nSingaporean dotcom "incubator" Fatfish​ Group came back to the market with a Plan B on Tuesday after its investors gave it a lesson in democracy last week. They unceremoniously dumped its plan to spin-off, and list, mobile phone game maker, iCandy.\n\nFatfish​ said that, after consulting with iCandy's​ board, the ASX, and its own investors, it remains "committed to pursuing the proposed spin-off and listing" of iCandy​.\n\nTo avoid another rejection by shareholders at the next meeting, it proposes to retain a larger stake in iCandy​ and distribute fewer shares to its shareholders.\n\nMind you, its investors might have been reacting to the restatement of Fatfish's accounts last week by its auditors from MSI Ragg Weir.\n\nIt appears the backdoor listing of the Fatfish business in July last year, via Atech Holdings, did not meet certain accounting standards.\n\nThis means the purchase of one particular Fatfish​ business should have been accounted for as a cost rather than as "goodwill on acquisition".\n\nThis basically doubled the company's net loss for the year ending December 31, 2014, from $6.5 million to $12.5 million. It reported revenue of $507,310 for that year.\n\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

15d53efb-2151-4164-aee0-cae51faedeeb	,  6:21 PM ET) -- Construction vehicle company Caterpillar is still on the hook for $4.5 million in damages after the Washington State Court of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict in favor of the wife of a construction worker who sued the company and others on claims stemming from her husband’s death due to asbestos exposure. \nThe three-judge panel affirmed the judgment on product liability, failure to warn and negligence claims, finding that Betty Estenson and her husband Edwin, before he died of mesothelioma in February 2012, had presented sufficient evidence...
fe6e8fcc-1128-4410-923d-f05c42174336	  Tags:     News: Software      |      AEX:WKL              This was published: 17 Sep 2015 - 06:27 pm \n    &nbsp Tweet           \n    &nbsp   \n \nAn early glimpse at the income tax picture for 2016 is now available \n      from Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US. The new information includes \n      estimated ranges for each 2016 tax bracket as well as projections for a \n      growing number of inflation-sensitive tax figures, such as the personal \n      exemption and the standard deduction. Projections are based on the \n      relevant inflation data recently released by the U.S. Department of \n      Labor. \n  \n Inflation Adjustments - Background  \n \nSince the late 1980s, the U.S. Tax Code has required that federal income \n      tax brackets be adjusted for inflation annually, and inflation \n      adjustments have been inserted into the Internal Revenue Code in recent \n      years with increasing frequency. For example, the Code now requires over \n      50 other inflation-driven computations to determine deduction, exemption \n      and exclusion amounts in addition to the 40 separate computations needed \n      to inflation-adjust the tax bracket tables each year. \n \n Media Assistance  \n \nExpert analysis plus additional details regarding the following \n      projections and tax topics are available for media members interested in \n      speaking with federal tax experts at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US. \n      For interview requests, please contact Laura Gingiss ( laura.gingiss@wolterskluwer.com ), \n      847-267-2213 or Eric Scott ( eric.scott@wolterskluwer.com ), \n      847-267-2179. \n \n Key Tax Savings, Non-increase Estimates for 2016 : \n \nProjections based on the Department of Labor's inflation figures for the \n      12-month period between August 31, 2014, and August 31, 2015 suggest \n      most taxpayers will experience modest savings, compared to 2015 tax \n      filings. For example: \n Because of the income ranges bracketing the marginal tax rates have \n        increased, a single filer with taxable income of $50,000 should owe \n        $22.50 less next year due to the adjustments to the income tax rate \n        brackets between 2015 and 2016.  A married couple filing jointly with a total taxable income of \n        $100,000 should pay $45 less income taxes in 2016 than they will on \n        the same income for 2015 because of indexing of their tax bracket for \n        2016.  The dependent standard deduction, used on the returns of individuals \n        claimed as dependents on another taxpayer's tax return, remains at \n        $1,050 for 2016.  The additional standard deduction for those 65-years-old and older or \n        who are blind will remain at $1,250 for 2016, as will the $1,550 \n        additional amount for single aged 65 or older or blind filers.  \n Inflation-adjusted Tax Increase Estimates for 2016:  \n The personal exemption amount gets bumped up by inflation by $50, to \n        $4,050 for 2016, up from $4,000 in 2015.  The standard deduction for single, married filing jointly, and married \n        filing separately filers is expected to remain the same for 2016. The \n        standard deduction for heads of household is expected to rise from \n        $9,250 for 2015 to $9,300 for 2016. Any increase in the standard \n        deduction, of course, can produce lower taxes by decreasing the \n        taxpayer's taxable income.  Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US projects the following for 2016 \n        alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemptions: For married joint filers and surviving spouses, the exemption will \n            be adjusted upward to $83,800, up from $83,400 for 2015.  For unmarried single filers and heads of households, the 2016 \n            exemption will be $53,900, up from $53,600 for 2015.  For married single filers, the exemption will increase to $41,900, \n            up from $41,700 in 2015.   The 2016 year represents the third year that the 39.6-percent tax \n        bracket for higher-income taxpayers, enacted by the American Taxpayer \n        Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), will be imposed. For 2016, Wolters Kluwer \n        projects that the minimum income amounts at which this top tax rate \n        will kick in will rise to: $466,950 (from $464,850) for married joint filers  $441,000 (from $439,000) for heads of households  $415,050 (from $413,200) for unmarried filers  $233,475 (from $232,425) for married separate filers  These inflation-adjusted amounts also trigger a 20-percent tax on \n            that portion of taxable income attributable to net capital gains \n            and qualified dividends that exceed these bracket amounts.   The estate and gift tax applicable exemption was first set at a $5 \n        million level back in 2011. The amount has been adjusted for inflation \n        by Congress and is now projected at $5,450,000 for 2016. A spousal \n        portability election can now effectively protect double that amount \n        against estate and gift tax ($10,900,000 for 2016).  The 2016 foreign earned income exclusion will increase to $101,300 for \n        2016, up from $100,800 for 2015.  The income phaseout range for married joint filers making Roth IRA \n        contributions will be $184,000 to $194,000 for 2016, an increase from \n        $183,000 and $193,000 for 2015.  \n Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US 2016 Tax \n      Projections *  \n \nAs cited earlier, Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US projections for \n      indexed amounts are based on the relevant inflation data released by the \n      U.S. Department of Labor. The IRS usually releases official numbers by \n      December each year. \n \nTax bracket projections are provided for illustrative purposes only, and \n      should not be used for income tax returns or other federal income tax \n      related purposes until confirmed by the IRS later this year. \n \n Married Filing Jointly (& Surviving Spouse)  \n Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â    \n Tax Rate  \n  Â   Â    2016 Taxable Income   Â   Â    2015 Taxable Income   10%  Â   Â   $0 â€“ $18,550  Â   Â   $0 â€“ $18,450  15%  Â   Â   $18,551 â€“ $75,300  Â   Â   $18,451 â€“ $74,900  25%  Â   Â   $75,301 â€“ $151,900  Â   Â   $74,901 â€“ $151,200  28%  Â   Â   $151,901 â€“ $231,450  Â   Â   $151,201 â€“ $230,450  33%  Â   Â   $231,451 â€“ $413,350  Â   Â   $230,451 â€“ $411,500  35%  Â   Â   $413,351 â€“ $466,950  Â   Â   $411,501 â€“ $464,850  39.6%  Â   Â   $466,951+  Â   Â   $464,851+    Â   Â     Â   Â                 Â   \n Unmarried Individuals (Other Than Surviving Spouses and Heads of \n      Households)  \n Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â    \n Tax Rate  \n  Â   Â    2016 Taxable Income   Â   Â    2015 Taxable Income   10%  Â   Â   $0 â€“ $9,275  Â   Â   $0 â€“ $9,225  15%  Â   Â   $9,276 â€“ $37,650  Â   Â   $9,226 â€“ $37,450  25%  Â   Â   $37,651 â€“ $91,150  Â   Â   $37,451 â€“ $90,750  28%  Â   Â   $91,151 â€“ $190,150  Â   Â   $90,751 â€“ $189,300  33%  Â   Â   $190,151 â€“ $413,350  Â   Â   $189,301 â€“ $411,500  35%  Â   Â   $413,351 â€“ $415,050  Â   Â   $411,501 â€“ $413,200  39.6%  Â   Â   $415,051+  Â   Â   $413,201+    Â   Â     Â   Â                 Â   \n Head of Household  \n Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â    \n Tax Rate  \n  Â   Â    2016 Taxable Income   Â   Â    2015 Taxable Income   10%  Â   Â   $0 â€“ $13,250  Â   Â   $0 â€“ $13,150  15%  Â   Â   $13,251 â€“ $50,400  Â   Â   $13,151 â€“ $50,200  25%  Â   Â   $50,401 â€“ $130,150  Â   Â   $50,201 â€“ $129,600  28%  Â   Â   $130,151 â€“ $210,800  Â   Â   $129,601 â€“ $209,850  33%  Â   Â   $210,801 â€“ $413,350  Â   Â   $209,851 â€“ $411,500  35%  Â   Â   $413,351 â€“ $441,000  Â   Â   $411,501 â€“ $439,000  39.6%  Â   Â   $441,001+  Â   Â   $439,001+    Â   Â     Â   Â                 Â   \n Married Individuals Filing Separate Returns  \n Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â    \n Tax Rate  \n  Â   Â    2016 Taxable Income   Â   Â    2015 Taxable Income   10%  Â   Â   $0 â€“ $9,275  Â   Â   $0 â€“ $9,225  15%  Â   Â   $9,276 â€“ $37,650  Â   Â   $9,226 â€“ $37,450  25%  Â   Â   $37,651 â€“ $75,950  Â   Â   $37,451 â€“ $75,600  28%  Â   Â   $75,951 â€“ $115,725  Â   Â   $75,601 â€“ $115,225  33%  Â   Â   $115,726 â€“ $206,675  Â   Â   $115,226 â€“ $205,750  35%  Â   Â   $206,676 â€“ $233,475  Â   Â   $205,751 â€“ $232,425  39.6%  Â   Â   $233,476+  Â   Â   $232,426+    Â   Â     Â   Â                 Â   \n Standard Deduction Amounts  \n Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â    \n Filing Status  \n  Â    2016   Â   Â    2015   Â   Â    Increase   Married Filing Jointly (& Surviving Spouse)  Â   $12,600  Â   Â   $12,600  Â   Â   $0  Married Filing Separately  Â   $6,300  Â   Â   $6,300  Â   Â   $0  Single  Â   $6,300  Â   Â   $6,300  Â   Â   $0  Head of Household  Â   $9,300  Â   Â   $9,250  Â   Â   $50    Â     Â   Â     Â   Â                     Â   \n Standard Deduction for Dependents ('Kiddieâ€� Standard Deduction)  \n Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â    2016   Â   Â   Â    2015   Â   Â   Â    Increase   $1,050  Â   Â   Â   $1,050  Â   Â   Â   $0    Â   Â   Â     Â   Â   Â                     Â   \n Personal Exemption Amounts  \n Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â    2016   Â   Â   Â    2015   Â   Â   Â    Increase   $4,050  Â   Â   Â   $4,000  Â   Â   Â   $50    Â   Â   Â     Â   Â   Â                     Â   \n Gift Tax Exclusion  \n Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â   Â    2016   Â   Â   Â    2015   Â   Â   Â    Increase   $14,000  Â   Â   Â   $14,000  Â   Â   Â   $0    Â   Â   Â     Â   Â   Â                     Â   \n* These numbers are projected for the 2016 tax year and have not been \n      confirmed by the Internal Revenue Service ( www.irs.org ). \n \nArticle source - Business Wire, all right reserved.

8b31ede3-0f3b-431a-86a3-342ee18cfd83	Just what Sherlock needed after his relapse: to come face-to-face with his daddy issues. When  Elementary  returns this fall, Sherlock ( Jonny Lee Miller ) will be dealing with the aftermath of his relapse in last season's finale. One of the consequences? His father Morland Holmes, played by John Noble , is coming to New York to check up on his son. Morland is an international consultant who has a lot of power and has amassed a considerable fortune. "He's someone who works from the shadows to help various governments and mega-corps and titans of industry make moves around the globe," creator Rob Doherty tells TVGuide.com. "He has the ear of many important and wealthy and influential people. He has a personality that's very appropriate to that kind of work and those kinds of worlds: He's very stern, very calculating, extremely bright -- but that's probably not a big surprise. Like Sherlock, he's typically a few moves ahead of the people he works with and then [is] able to predict certain behaviors." Check out all this week's Mega Buzz! Whether or not the elder Holmes will try to apply those skills to his son remains to be seen, but Morland will stick his nose into Sherlock's first case back, which is loosely inspired by the canonical story, "The Adventure of Wysteria Lodge." Guest star Patrick Page, whom we met in last season's finale, will reprise the role of Jonathan Bloom, a man with an unsavory history of preying on desperate women who then disappear. This time, however, Bloom will seek out Sherlock for help. "Bloom insists that he is not responsible for the disappearance of at least one of the women," Doherty says. "His wife vanished without a trace five years ago. He's always insisted that he's innocent. He's been in the tabloids quite a bit. So, he approaches Sherlock, engages him and wants Sherlock Holmes to prove that he's innocent of his wife's disappearance." Elementary returns for its fourth season on Thursday, Nov. 4 at 10/9c on CBS. Crave scoop on your favorite TV shows?

"She's disappointed in herself for not being stronger and I'm sad for her too. It was a place she loved very much, but at the moment it will always be somewhere that reminds her of what Lachlan did. But, down the line, who knows what might happen?" \n \nSo is there not even a small part of her that wants to stay? "No, absolutely not. She misses her sister, but not everything else. They're also dealing with Val's death, which is bleak and upsetting, especially for Jacob. So it's become a dark place for her, whereas Portugal is lovely and sunny. Over there, she felt like she had a future again." \n \nDavid has, of course, been preoccupied with looking out for his grieving dad Eric's welfare. But viewers - and Alicia - know that he would in fact do anything to stay in the village and not return overseas. And, in the end, it's only when David's mask slips that the whole truth comes out. \n \n"Alicia loves David deeply, but she's becoming frustrated with him because she wants him to have the courage to say that he never wanted to go to Portugal and doesn't want to go back," continues Anderson. "She feels like he's using his dad as an excuse. She would have more respect for him if he just came out and said it. Then when he does, that stresses her out a lot." \n       \nAs for Anderson, the storyline marks the end of her five years on the ITV soap. "The fans have been so kind," she says. "I've had lots of messages saying that they can't believe I'm leaving. Prior to the helicopter crash, there was a lot of speculation that Alicia would die. I've been overwhelmed by the support that the fans have shown both me and my on-screen family." \n \nAnd who is she going to miss the most? "Everyone! Obviously my girls - Roxy Shahidi, Fiona Wade and Gaynor Faye. I'll miss them deeply. But obviously my family as well. I'll miss them all." \n \nYou can watch a 60-second rundown of next week's episodes of Emmerdale below. \n \nAnd visit our dedicated Emmerdale page for all the latest news, interviews and spoilers.
c27a162d-f2d1-4bdb-84ba-0915a082775b	NBC's new drama The Player  has one of the most ridiculous premises of any of the new fall TV shows -- but that's not a bad thing. Unlike so many of the shows trying to "cut through the clutter" with a splashy concept, The Player knows exactly what it wants to be: a high-octane crime thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously. And it shouldn't with a setup like this: Alex Kane ( Philp Winchester ) is a private security specialist in Las Vegas who, after the murder of his wife Ginny ( Daisy Betts ), is pulled into a long-running conspiracy involving the richest people in the world gambling on crime. With the help of "pit boss" Mr. Johnson ( Wesley Snipes ) and "the dealer" Cassandra ( Charity Wakefield ), Alex, as "the player," tries to stop crimes while the fat cats in "the house" bet on or against his ability to save the day. Got all that? "We knew we wanted to make a pulp show," co-creator John Rogers tells TVGuide.com . "The way pulp works is to find a good, simple, defining metaphor, and we said, 'What are the elements of gambling?' If you're going to have a conspiracy, you're going to have code names, you're going to a have a structure. When we looked at the basic form of gambling, the feel of a casino, and it just came very naturally. People understand those terms -- millions of people gamble. We're not introducing obscure vocabulary to explain our very high-concept, obscure conspiracy." Fall Preview: Check out all the must-watch new shows But it was also important for Rogers to have some emotional context beneath all the Las Vegas window-dressing. "Everyone right now feels as if maybe the rules were changed on them," Rogers says. "You sent your kids to college, but somehow your college graduate is living in your basement because he can't get a job. It feels like we're trapped in a game that somebody changed the rules. We said, 'Why don't we externalize that? Why don't we talk about the fact we are trapped in a game, and there's one guy in the middle of it who is on our side?' That gave us the emotional stakes of the show." Page 2 of 3 - For Alex, his journey is entirely fueled by the heartbreak he feels over the death of his wife. "Trying to resolve how Ginny died and why she died and who's responsible, is the primary emotional thrust of his investigation," Rogers says. "That's the thing that keeps him going back undercover into this organization." And continuing to go back in is an issue. After all, the whole concept of a group of people profiting off of crime rather than trying to prevent it is pretty icky, right? "They're doing a horrible thing," Rogers says with a laugh. "It allows us to have some fun every week, but they're plainly bad guys. Alex is a good guy in the middle of a bad system. One of the essential questions of the show is: Is that system actually the best possible system that we can live with?" Because of Alex's unease about what he's doing, The Player is unlike most procedurals where the team is one big happy family. Instead, when, in the pilot, Alex threatens to kill Mr. Johnson one day in the not-too-distant future, you're inclined to believe him. However, the team still has to rely on each other, regardless of how much they trust their colleagues. "Everyone has their own agenda, everyone has their own secret plan, and everyone has their own sort of shifting allegiances," Rogers says. "They are in a life-and-death world, and they have to trust each other as far as they can to not die, but never trust each other enough to make themselves vulnerable." The Player 's Wesley Snipes and more familiar faces in new places That central conflict will certainly begin to define Mr. Johnson's moral ambiguity, which is exactly what attracted Snipes to the role. "I get to explore some character work in a way that I probably couldn't in a feature film," Snipes says. "You never know which side he's playing for. You'll learn quickly that Mr. Johnson knows secrets that no one else knows. He's seen a lot of players come and go, and this guy is nothing special at this point. Or so we make it appear. Mr. Johnson has another card that he hasn't played yet. There's a whole deck that Mr. Johnson hasn't played yet." However, Rogers is quick to caution people from deciding outright that Mr. Johnson is the bad guy. "There are weeks that Mr. Johnson does something heroic because it fits his sense of personal ethics, and you're like, 'Yeah, I love Mr. Johnson!'" Rogers says. "Then, there are days that he's the most horrible human being in the world. I don't know if you ever want to be rooting for him, but you should be fascinated by him. ... His views on power are not necessarily wrong, they're just horrible." Page 3 of 3 - Then again, Alex isn't an entirely noble hero either. "He's saving lives. He genuinely enjoys the work, but Alex Kane has a problem. He is a man with a high capacity for violence and a tendency towards it," Rogers says. "To a great degree the two themes for the show are power and addiction. We all have behaviors we're drawn to. We all have those things we can't let go of, be it Ginny's death or the constant fall into violence which comes very easily to him. We all have these desires that are beyond our control, and how we deal with them to a great degree is what defines us." Although the show is clearly reveling in its procedural makeup ("I love the one-and-done of it," Rogers confesses), the writers are telling a longer story. However, the central mystery of Ginny's murder, which gets much more messy by the end of the pilot, won't be stretched out forever. "The mystery of how that happened, who did it, why it was done -- all of that is meant to be an important thing that we reveal to the audience over the course of the first 12 episodes," Rogers says. "We're not going to hold you over a barrel for five years. Most of the questions in the first season will be resolved by the end of the first season." The Player premieres Thursday at 10/9c on NBC.

df13cc43-53fd-4f09-9a7e-d69b12a4adc0	Dame Joan Collins said she used to "nag" her sister Jackie about getting mammograms but she "refused". \n \n\t\t \nJackie, who sold more than 500 million novels in more than 40 countries in her  four decades-long career as a writer in raunchy female fiction, died of breast  cancer last Saturday aged 77. \n  Joan and Jackie Collins during the filming of the 2013 New Year's Eve Graham Norton Show   \nDame Joan said she and her sister were "thick as thieves" but admitted they did have "estrangements" in the past. \n\n\t\t\t \nDespite being diagnosed six-and-a-half years ago, British author Jackie, who lived  in Beverley Hills, told few people about her illness, saying she did not want to  ''burden'' others with it. \n\n\n\n \nIn an online post called A Tribute To My Beloved Sister, Dame Joan wrote: "I used to nag my sister about getting mammograms, as our darling mother Elsa had succumbed to the disease in 1962 when she was only in her early fifties. \n\n"I was religious about doing mammograms regularly. Jackie however refused - she didn't even like going to doctors. Like my brother and I she was needle-phobic." \n\nDame Joan, who said she and Jackie were " thick as thieves", also revealed the moment Jackie rang her to say she had stage four breast cancer. \n\nShe only found out about her sister's illness in the fortnight before her death. \n\n\t\t\t \nShe said Jackie told her that she did not want to upset her, adding that she said: " I know all the problems you've been having in the past few years - I didn't want to burden you with mine." \n\nDame Joan wrote: "My voice was so choked with tears I could hardly speak." \n\nThe pair, who had been rumoured at times to have a difficult relationship, were pictured together in London just a few days before the death when Jackie was on a promotional tour for her new novel The Santangelos. \n\nIn her tribute, Dame Joan wrote: "Jackie really enjoyed her life so much and lived it to the hilt, and when we were together, even if we hadn't seen each other for a few months, we were thick as thieves." \n\n\t\t\t \nDame Joan said Jackie "hated" her fourth husband Peter Holm, adding: "She begged me not to marry him but unfortunately I went ahead - one of the worst decisions of my life. Jackie and I didn't see each other so much during that period." \n\nShe went on: "Unfortunately, a couple of years later another relationship I had came between us and, having moved back to Europe, we couldn't be as close as we wanted to be. \n\n"Sisters will have their estrangements but happily when that relationship ended and I moved back to LA Jackie and I resumed our devotion to each other." \n\nShe added: "I've never had a better girlfriend than Jackie, with whom I shared so much in common and could enjoy talking and gossiping away about everything when we were together, going to our favourite restaurants or to the movies or on long distance phone calls." \n\nIn her concluding few lines, Dame Joan said: "I don't think I will ever recover from the sadness of losing my beautiful baby sister." \n\n\t\t\t \nShe added: "She will live on in the wonderful memories I have of her from our childhood and particularly from the last fifteen years, during which we were closer than ever. I feel her spirit, I hear her wonderful laugh and I see her all the time in the hundreds of photos of her that are sprinkled around my home. \n\n"She wasn't just a star - to me she was an entire galaxy." \n\nDame Joan has requested that people who read her online tribute make donations to Penny Brohn Cancer Care in the UK and the Susan G. Komen breast cancer organisation in the USA. \n\n\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.
f642dff5-2cd3-46a0-b530-792529a8ebb2	“While menopause affects women physically, it’s not the lack of sex, night sweats or fatigue that leave men feeling unloved. It’s the emotional loss of their partne."  \n Houston TX (PRWEB)  September 17, 2015  \n\nMenopause is no longer just for ‘older women’ with hot flashes, irritability and night sweats.  An estimated 6,000 baby boomer women in the U.S. reach menopause every day and suffer both physical and emotional symptoms that can linger and interfere with their relationships and marriages.  Hesitant to share her new emotions with her husband, divorce sometimes ensues. \n \n“Men often wonder why she rejects him in the bedroom, why she doesn’t want to go out as much, and why she seems colder, more anxious and feels old, unattractive, overweight, tired,  overwhelmed and confused or depressed,” says  Mary Jo Rapini, a licensed psychotherapist and co-author of newly published, Re-Coupling: A Couple’s 4-step Guide to Greater Intimacy and Better Sex. “While menopause affects women physically, it’s not the lack of sex, night sweats or fatigue that leave men feeling unloved. It’s the emotional loss of their partner. He sees her as still being beautiful, witty, charming, sexy and his main confidante’. Anyone who has ever tried to tell a woman she is beautiful when she believes she is not understands how futile it is and how easily she will dismiss the comment even if it was said with sincerity.” \n \nThese 10 tips help couples cope with the change and can even draw one another closer: \n \n1.    Don’t take menopase symptoms personally. \n2.    Explore new ways to be intimate, the ones you traditionally used may not be comfortable anymore. \n3.    When she’s most irritable or angry ask her what’s going on--it most likely has nothing to do with ou. \n4.    If there’s a problem, don’t ignore it--talk about t.  \n5.    If she’s having hot flashes, cuddling or sleeping together might be too uncomfortable. Allow her space, but let her know you’re thre. \n6.    Many women suffer with their loss of fertility. Be patient, listen and don’t make joke. \n7.    There are no quick medical treatments available for the physical or emotional aspects as helpful as a loving, supportive partner. Hormone therapy helps, but it isn’t a magic cure, and many women cannot use it  \n8.    If sex is being avoided, it doesn’t mean she doesn’t love you anymore. It might be painful. Replens is a non-hormonal moisturizer that provides comfortable relief for three days and a good silicone lubricant like Wet Platinum or Replens Silky Smooth should be used just before and during sx.  \n9.    Fifty is a tough time for men too, so be patient with one another. Mid-life is a couple’s challenge. Many men are silently suffering from erectile dysfunction. Stronvivo is a nutritional supplement that improves blood flow and erectile function by keeping blood circulating smoothly throughout the body, delivering nutrients and oxygen to the brain, muscles, organs, and skin. Natural pharmaceutical-grade ingredients including L-Arginine and L-Citrulline among others to support healthy hormone levels resulting in stronger erections for men making it a perfect companion to testosterone replacement therapy and increased sexual desire for women enhancing lubrication, arousal and orgasms while reducing vaginal pai. \n10.    Depression and anxiety can be part of menopause. Take it seriously and encourage her to talk to a mental health care professional if her symptoms become severe or persistent.  \n“Couples who embrace the change in life as a temporary condition and go through it together do much better and remain much closer than those who don’t,” adds Rapini. \n  \nShare article on social media or email
d63353aa-58f1-413d-8f60-fac44c41d4b7	The Dom Post reports : \n \nA Wellington woman tried to explain to a brutal rapist that she could be pregnant with her first child and begged him not to hurt her. \n \nIt did not matter to Bailey Meredith, 17, who violated her over and over during an attack on the Hutt River riverbank on June 11 before beating her unconscious. \n \nShe had been out walking when he had grabbed her from behind, ordering her to her knees before saying he intended to rape her. \n \nThe victim went on to explain about IVF which she and her husband had been going through but it made no difference.  They were to find out if she was pregnant that weekend instead she was being treated for her injuries and tested for sexually transmitted diseases. \n \nMeredith had pleaded guilty to rape, four charges of unlawful sexual connection, abduction with intent to rape, wounding with intent to injure and threatening to kill.  He has been jailed for eight years. \n \nThat seems light to me. In 2010 I blogged the Court of Appeal guidelines being : \n  Rape Band 1 (6 to 8 yrs) – offending at the lower end of the spectrum where there are no aggravating factors, no serious violence, no abduction, the victim is not very young or very old.  Rape Band 2 (7 to 13 yrs) – involves moderate violence, pre-meditation, a rape involving more than one offender, or an especially vulnerable victim  Rape Band 3 (12 to 18 yrs) – offending with serious additional violence, wit multiple (three or more) aggravating factors. For particularly cruel, callous or violent rapes.  Rape Band 4 (16 to 20 yrs) – for multiple offending over considerable periods of time, gang or pack rape.   \nThere was obvious serious violence that left her unconscious.  It would seem to me the case would be Rape Band 2 or 3, not Rape Band 1. \n \nOfficer in charge of the investigation, Detective Sergeant Nick Pritchard, said it was one of the worst cases he had investigated. \n \n“This was a sexual attack that involved extreme violence. It was one of the most violent sexual attacks I’ve seen in my career,” he said. \n \nSo eight years seems rather light. He did plead guilty which gets 10% to 33% knocked off.  But in theory he could be out of jail in under three years. \n \n  \nTags: rape
b4968e78-ec5a-466e-863f-fef18e8ae99d	From the Wires Sep. 10, 2015 02:00 PM \n   \n    \n\nHOUSTON, TX -- (Marketwired) -- 09/10/15 -- Heritage Texas Properties (Heritage), the largest independently owned residential real estate firm in the Greater Houston region, names Chaille Ralph, last year's Chair of the Houston Association of Realtors®, as its new President. \n\nMrs. Robin Mueck, owner and CEO of one of Houston's most recognized and honored real estate brokerages, becomes Chairman and CEO to lead the firm's business development and local community outreach efforts. Jerry Mueck, Executive Vice President and husband of Robin, is also an owner. \n\n"Our people are our greatest strength," says Mueck, "and we now have in place a vibrant new management team -- led by an admired and proven leader, Chaille Ralph. Our leadership team has a shared vision to provide exciting new growth and innovation that will deliver even greater geographic reach, and inspired personal service to delight our clients." \n\n Heritage , which will celebrate its 40th Anniversary next year, has grown under Mueck's leadership from a few dozen agents in one office to 16 locations from the Gulf Coast to Central Texas, home to more than 300 licensed Realtors. It has been recognized as one of the top brokerage firms in the U.S. by REAL Trends. As a member of the prestigious Leading Real Estate Companies of the World and Luxury Portfolio, and a past recipient of its Most Innovative Brokerage Award, Heritage also is part of a global marketing network of 500+ real estate firms with 3,500 offices and 120,000 sales associates spanning 50 countries. This exclusive partnership allows Heritage to promote its properties to potential buyers all over the world. \n\nMs. Ralph, a licensed real estate broker since 1982, has been with Heritage since 2009, most recently as Senior Vice President of Sales for the company's Post Oak, Downtown and Galveston locations. A respected industry leader, she serves as a Director of the National Association of Realtors, the Texas Association of Realtors and the Houston Association of Realtors. She's a native Houstonian, alumnae of St. Thomas Episcopal School, and graduated from Texas Christian University with a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration. \n\nMs. Ralph will lead the day-to-day operations, heading the new leadership team for Heritage . In related moves, Sandy Benson, Senior Vice President, is now responsible for sales companywide, supporting top line growth and overseeing branch leaders. Kristen Abney, Senior Vice President, heads up the highly profitable relocation division as well as strategic initiatives and special projects.

Mrs. Mueck believes that her burgeoning enterprise will continue to expand, as it attracts the best talent from both the "Next Gen" and seasoned veterans. \n\n"While these innovative moves create an energy and excitement among the Heritage family that will help us grow and serve our clients better than ever," Mrs. Mueck adds, "Our traditional values remain unchanged: We have built our culture around attracting people of integrity who genuinely care and have concern for our clients and each other, which is rare. We do it right.

"I'm thrilled to transition Chaille to lead the day-to-day operations to allow me to focus on exciting new growth initiatives and deepen our long-standing relationship with the community." \n\nMrs. Mueck notes that Ms. Ralph's appointment to President is the third major initiative Heritage has undertaken in recent months. In June, the company unveiled its new logo and brand identity. The effort, says VP of Marketing Jaclyn Reed who spearheaded the effort, was designed to "visually align our brand with the modern company Heritage has become, yet underscore our long-standing image of quality, service and sophistication based on our tradition of excellence and integrity." \n\nSecond, Heritage is renovating its flagship Post Oak Park office, which reopens on October 1, 2015.

"This expansion will enable increased marketing support," says Mrs. Mueck, including marketing for builders, development support, and personal branding for agents. "Our flagship office paints a new picture of innovation and progress, still suitable for our established traditions," she adds. The location will be used for state-of-the-art corporate video production, video conferencing, and distance learning to support Heritage Texas Properties located throughout the state. \n\n Heritage Texas Properties has a legacy of leadership that includes five former Chairs of the Houston Association of Realtors, with four still part of the Heritage Texas Properties team, including Mrs. Mueck, Ms. Ralph, Mr. Jones and Lynn Zarr, Sr. \n\n About Heritage Texas Properties  \n\n Heritage Texas Properties , founded in 1976, is the largest independently owned residential real estate firm in the markets it serves, including Houston (5 offices), Katy, Cypress, The Woodlands, Sugar Land, Galveston, New Braunfels, Seguin, Round Top, Brenham, Bellville, and La Grange.

43c02bac-d556-4851-9b04-7773700759b6	So you know before you go any additional… After all literary critique, not, like, constructive critique (or destructive critique, which I think of will be formative in its individual way.) For some thing down many lines, see on this website and right here. \n \nA career in academia usually requires a variety of twists and spins. My University or college of Venus co-workers is a prosperous cross-area of the many ways we could go after be successful in advanced schooling. My very own direction was pretty simple and easy, for considerably better or even more serious; most days and nights I believe much better. \n \nIf there have been twists and becomes, they are generally interior. Once I got tenure and became a office lounge chair, I believed more details about becoming an administrator. Not really whether or not to end up being a particular, but what exactly the deliver the results way and the way to accomplish it top. I thought about the main difference between administering and primary; I picked up the things it intended to be visioning, and (or?) to be visualizing logically.  But I also considered my hue-coded Custom Dissertation and seen that slots relating to managing, in lieu of creating, had been more prevalent. I didn’t experience the very thought of a lot more numerous years in that work along with a GCal that appeared individuals. \n \nWhen I navigated just what it signifies as a online digital scholastic (a little something I’m today authoring on somewhere else), I evolved an individuality through social media – someone linked, anybody networked, plus the substance place of consistently trying to learn and thriving that this kind of personal identity confers. There is a lot of wonderful writing on the market to the purpose of social sites in acquiring and cultivating id, but I’ll just primary individuals to just one of one of the best authors on the subject, Rey Junco. Whilst loads of his job targets students, it appears to be for me that many of us may just be in your comparable see as our learners, studying our own selves. \n \nChecking out my GCal, considering showing a deal with for that encounters I come in contact with (to paraphrase T. S. Eliot) internet and away, and achieving to a point in my livelihood wherever I really could flip a little more of my focus on authoring and researching, I purchased to wanting to know where exactly I may try to find devices, probably new models. Right After I train, We have a more than likely irritating practice of expressing “I wish to be so-and-when I build up” to speak about authors I am just certainly excited about. Simply because of a few things i instruct, both individuals who buy this therapy relatively routinely are George Eliot and Virginia Woolf.  (Go ahead and speculate on which this suggests about me.) But once I last but not least have a chance to take a seat and catch up on to come back challenges of your New York Analysis of Literature, or I’m diving into critique and primary research for my own personal creating, or I am transported a novel to review, I come across other types:  Zadie Smith, Stephen Gill, Seamus Perry, Maria DiBattista, Robert Spoo. \n \nEducating, mixed with wondering much more about my producing and developing some new developments, has become me concerned about precisely how, to acquire a literary critic or scholar of literature or whathaveyou, critique is often a blog for personal identity evolution. An innovative way to bear in mind or control persons twists and becomes.  When I’m training scholars about the deliver the results of literary criticism, I usually take a look at just how the locations we are enthusiastic about searching alot more profoundly by way of literature originate from http://dissertationcheap.com/custom-dissertation/ - it is not at all times specific, but it’s a portion of the formula. \n \nI became just recently finding out about and publishing a convention cardstock on Virginia Woolf’s dad, Leslie Stephen, a now type of ignored critic of the Victorian interval whose undertake the poet William Wordsworth affirms a whole lot more about Stephen than it does about Wordsworth.  I discovered , by myself composing an extremely strange digression in the heart of my paper. It moved like this: \n \nOne of the many options I really hope this newspaper has lit is that often pundits discover methods of currently being off their things, even while the repair of critique additionally, the all round performance of critic is but a reflection, and that if we understand it or otherwise, our company is drawn to produce critique on subject areas that meet with who we are as mankind and who we should be. We can imagine types in our own personal selves because we produce readings that will be editions of the themes. Conceivably many of us would acquire more total satisfaction within duties when we reclaimed a minimum of one small percentage of this a sense of the things it usually means to be a critic, as built-in and interconnected in some sort of all natural tactic to the rest of our way of life. \n \nGood, I chop that continue sentence within the authentic demonstration – but while I didn’t know to start with the actual way it was that this crazy tangent popped out once i was covering an obscure Victorian, I do believe I realize since some thing relating to this critic seeing a poet who spoke to him in a time of superb suffering, after which it sensation compelled to produce an essay to fix it, really resonated with me.  The  on Wordsworth that surfaced from Stephen’s checking out will not be particularly particular except if you know things concerning biographical origins (going back to Wordsworth inside periods once his initial wife’s unpredicted passing away).  But the call to come up with a writer who strikes some nerve, and afterwards maybe think of a adaptation of you that links to the creator through the incredibly act of critique – I do believe I found myself dealing with — in public places —  some idea of the need of that advance. \n \nRegardless of the twists and turns my work or competent individuality as a possible school could possibly undertake, I always return to the books, the freelance writers, along with the other critics who maintain me and continue to show me. Normally i get back to them in search of new tips on how to be. read here
db60062c-cd21-40a5-ab3b-648d5a320bf2	A Beverley businessman is about to set off on a 720km bike ride across France to raise funds to fight the disease which claimed the life of his sister. \n\n\t\t \nRob Davies, director of Yourlink Ltd, on Annie Reed Industrial Estate, will cycle across the Pyrenees from Biaritz to Argeles-sur-mer in order to raise cash for research into leukaemia and  lymphoma. \n\nDescribing himself as “a complete novice” when it comes to cycling, he has set himself a time limit of just six days for the journey in which he will ride uphill to a height of 13,000 metre. \n\n\t\t\t \nHis late sister Alison Elliott was a top make-up artist in the film industry who died aged 47 just one week after being diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia, and two weeks before her twins’ first birthday.\n\n\n\n \nRob said: “Alison was a loving friend, sister, daughter, mother and wife, and I wanted to try and do something epic to raise money. \n\n“She was a very well-known and respected make-up designer having worked with many film stars from the likes of Emma Thompson to Michael Douglas. The film Nanny McPhee II was dedicated to her name.” \n\nRob’s trip will take him from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean coast. \n\nBut he won’t be alone because he’ll be accompanied on by  the trip by work colleague Patrick Konrath, also a novic cyclist. \n\n\t\t\t \nRob added: “We’ve been training for the past six months at Beverley Leisure centre and on local roads.

Inside, a delicious home-cooked meal is ready on the table…oh, and she’s wearing a bikini.There’s a new cafe in Tokyo where you can have all this and more, because the staff there are ready and waiting to be your bikini-and-apron-clad new wife (or husband).At Ore no Yome (literally “My Wife”) in Tokyo’s Higashi Ikebukuro neighborhood, they’ll always know your name. As long as you call and tell them beforehand, that is. It’s a concept cafe staffed by “wives” and “darling husbands” in swimsuits and aprons, whose mission is simple: to make you want to come “home” to them every night.“As soon as you know what time you’ll be home, let me know dear!” runs the ad. “I’ll get your dinner ready.”
bd104c74-afa6-4d79-bf24-3249c7643130	Maya Donnelly awoke to what sounded like thunder in the early morning hours, but dismissed it as a typical monsoon storm and went back to sleep. \n\nLater that morning, she looked in the carport at her home in Nogales, near the U.S.-Mexico border, and saw pieces of wood on the ground. She found a bulky bundle wrapped in black plastic. \n\nInside was roughly 26 pounds of marijuana — a package that authorities say was worth $10,000 and likely was dropped there accidentally by a drug smuggler's aircraft. \n\n"It's all right on top of our dog's house," Donnelly said of the Sept. 8 incident, which was first reported by the Nogales International newspaper. "It just made a perfectly round hole through our carport." \n\nLiving near the border, Donnelly said she assumed the object was drugs. She immediately called her husband, Bill, who told her to call 911. \n\nThe couple said officers who responded told them an ultralight aircraft smuggling marijuana from Mexico had probably let part of its load go early by accident before dropping the rest farther north, the newspaper reported. \n\nNogales Police Chief Derek Arnson said it's the first time in his three-year tenure that he's ever seen a load of drugs hit a building. \n\n"Someone definitely made a mistake, and who knows what the outcome of that mistake might be for them," Arnson said. \n\nPolice are trying to determine whether the bundle was transported by an aircraft or a pilotless drone. Such runs usually occur at night. \n\nMaya Donnelly said she thinks it's unlikely someone will come looking for the drugs, which are now in police custody. Arnson agreed but said police have boosted patrols in the Donnellys neighborhood for now. \n \nThe family will have to pay the estimated $500 in repairs, as well as pay for a new home for their German Shepherd, Hulk. But the scenario could have been much worse for the couple and their three teenage daughters. \n\n"Where it landed was clear on the other side of the house from the bedrooms," Maya Donnelly said. "We were lucky in that sense." \n\nFriends and family also have gotten a laugh. Several joked that the couple could have profited from the surprise package. \n\n"That's what everybody says: 'Why did you call 911?'" Maya Donnelly said. "But how can you have a clear conscience, right? We could have made lots of home repairs with that." \n\n___ \n\nFollow Terry Tang on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ttangAP

328b5f1c-2b52-4eac-916c-c7983d4882a4	I love health success stories. Who doesn’t?  \nMany of the “Before and After” stories we see online are related to weight loss. Getting that bikini shot after losing 50 pounds is fine and all, but I find the stories about overcoming chronic illness far more inspiring. \n \nThat’s why I’m stoked to share one of my student’s testimonials about her experience going through the Paleo Rehab: Adrenal Fatigue program. \n \nLeslie* contacted me after I asked the Paleo Rehab group to share their personal health journey related to their identification of HPA axis dysregulation (AKA “ adrenal fatigue “) and the health improvements they had after implementing the recommendations from the program. \n \nWhen Leslie told me our program “saved her life”, I had to find out more. Even I was in disbelief that our program could help someone achieve that level of health success from Paleo Rehab . \n \nHow could our online program have saved someone’s life? \n \nLeslie was kind enough to share her story publicly, for which I’m so grateful. I hope her experience gives you hope and confidence that you too can find the root of your health problems and begin overcoming them today . \n \nThank you for your story Leslie! <3 \n \n*Name has been changed for privacy. \n Leslie’s Story  \nThree years ago my health changed overnight, and my life went on hold. \n \nI would wake up every night around 1am with internal tremors in my neck, back and abdomen. They became progressively stronger throughout the night and I couldn’t sleep – sometimes for days at a time. They felt like I was having a seizure but I wasn’t. Occasionally the symptoms would happen during the day but for the most part it was at night. The conventional doctor initially thought it was a vitamin deficiency but I didn’t improve with supplementation. \n \nMonths passed living with these symptoms. The sleep deprivation was debilitating. I couldn’t understand why it was happening every night at the same time. The doctor thought it was stress and the only stress I had was from not knowing what was wrong with me. \n \nI thought my symptoms might be spine related so I went to see a Chiropractor and he was the first one to suggest “adrenal fatigue.”  He suggested I purchase Dr. Wilson’s book but when I read it the symptoms didn’t sound like mine, at the time, so I didn’t give it any more thought.  Over the years I forgot about it. \n \nNext I tried Osteopathy treatments for two years and I was told that I have a nervous system imbalance and could be fixed with osteopathy and acupuncture but it would take time. I was willing to give it time and went for treatment twice a week but there was no improvement.  During this time I decided to see a Naturopath and when I described my symptoms he looked at me with a little smile and said nothing. He offered no possible explanation. \n \nI went back to the conventional doctor who prescribed an MRI – the results were normal.  Then I had blood tests, x-rays and ultrasounds to rule out other conditions – they were normal. He thought the symptoms were probably menopausal and said that I am lucky because women who have hot flashes suffer more.  My condition was not considered as bad as hot flashes.  Basically, in a polite way, I was told to suck it up.  I didn’t know where to turn to for help. It was a terrible feeling to know that something was wrong and I didn’t know where to go for help. \n \nI felt abandoned and alone. \n \nI decided to try another Naturopath who said my symptoms were due to an underactive thyroid.  After a few months on thyroid supplementation there was no improvement and I was feeling worse with additional symptoms – severe muscular pain every morning for 2 to 3 hours, low blood sugar and lack of energy – almost bedridden. With each appointment I complained about them and one day she realized it was low cortisol, which she called Adrenal Fatigue.  She gave me an adrenal supplement but the other ingredients in this supplement didn’t agree with me and I had to stop taking it. \n \nShe offered little help with my diet even though she had a nutritional background.  When I explained that I was having a very difficult time controlling sugar levels and that I was eating almost every hour and a half during the day and several times throughout the night she gave me another supplement to balance sugar levels but it didn’t work. \n \nDesperate for answers I went to see an endocrinologist wondering if it really could be menopausal.  The endocrinologist said that I didn’t have an adrenal problem, that there is no precursor to Addison’s disease, that I didn’t have a blood sugar problem, and that what I have is a result of a stressful life. He said that those who have had a stressful life will have “one heck of a time when they reach menopause”.  He recommended hormone replacement therapy to get me over the hump for the next two years but I refused to take it because of the bad side effects. I didn’t need any more ailments to deal with. \n \nDuring the day I tried to get some sleep. I was lucky if I got an hour or two.  Any vitamins I tried to take made me severely dizzy for hours or made my hands tremble.  Walking across the room felt like I was going to drop to the ground from severe exhaustion and not only physical exhaustion but I felt an internal exhaustion like I was crumbling on the inside. All I wanted to do was stay in bed and rest. \n \nEvery night I was in survival mode.  Eat or pass out.  \n \nHungry or not I had to eat to keep my sugar levels up and most of the time – actually all of the time – I was not hungry at all and had to force the food down.  Eating several times during the night never gave me a restful sleep and I kept my husband awake too.  I had to get up so frequently that it would wake him.  Sometimes the sugar levels were so low that I’d be trembling and crying from fear and frustration. He’d get up to sit with me in the kitchen until my body absorbed the food and the symptoms settled down.  That was a regular event.  He was worried about my health, which then started to affect his. \n \nWhen I heard about the Paleo Rehab program I joined hoping that I could, at the very least, learn one or two things that would help me feel a bit better. \n \nThis program gave me much more than that. I am on my way to being normal again. \n \nAfter joining this program I made some diet changes: I increased protein, carb, fat and fiber intake in the recommended ratios.  I ate super foods, such as liver, and my muscular pain improved within a week while stabilizing my blood sugar.  To eliminate the muscle pain completely I increased soluble fiber and over a two-week period it worked – the pain is gone!  I’ve been pain-free for 6 weeks now and my blood sugar is stable.  I used to eat 8 meals a day plus 1 to 3 snacks throughout the night and now I am down to 5 meals and the occasional bedtime snack if I don’t eat enough calories during the day. \n \nI can finally sleep through the night. Finally. No more tremors. Adding meditation and a few, easy lifestyle changes to my daily routine has helped a lot too. \n \nI am also working one-on-one with Kelsey Marksteiner on individualized supplementation due to other health conditions that need attention. After 2 weeks of starting the new supplementation my blood sugar problems feel almost non-existent – the best they’ve ever been.  I know the sugar problem is there and I am in the healing stages so I won’t do anything crazy like go on a restrictive diet and act like it’s not a problem.  I know the problem is still there, but it does feel like it’s getting back to normal. \n \nI am healing. \n \nMy energy level is still low but I am confident that it will improve as well.  I know what and how much to eat to get and keep myself healthy. Today I understand that the tremors I had were caused from adrenaline peaks occurring around 1am and lowering blood sugar levels.   Cortisol is supposed to kick in to raise it but mine never did and my sugar levels remained low.  I was miserable every day from sleep deprivation, exhaustion and pain.  I stopped driving because I was afraid I’d fall asleep at the wheel. \n \nOnce I started sleeping through the night I was in a better mood – happier – and I could go out and do the things I used to do. My husband is so happy to see me getting back to normal – and so am I. \n \nWould you believe that I had spent close to $10,000 on healthcare practitioners with nothing to show for it?   \n \nIt’s hard to enjoy life when you don’t feel well and I was not going to give up on finding someone who could help me. I am so happy that I found the Paleo Rehab program .  The amount and the quality of the material are impressive and it is obvious how much time – and love – was put into it.  It is more than I ever expected. \n \nLaura and Kelsey – you saved my life. \n \nYes, that is exactly how I feel and I am not ashamed to say it even though it may sound exaggerated.  What I went through was horrible and only my husband knows the extent because he was there to witness it. \n \nYou helped me when no one else could and I don’t know where I’d be without you.    \n \nThank. You. So. Much. \n \n- Leslie
70ecb3ad-cbbe-4097-8608-e3373a34a728	The President of the United States accidentally left a copy of his White House Correspondents’ Dinner speech on his desk in the Oval Office. As a White House fellow, it’s your job to pick it up and bring it to him. Except when you get to the Oval Office, the door locks behind you. You can’t get out until you figure out what’s missing from the speech. What do you do? \n \nSo goes the scenario for Escape the Oval Office, one of two escape room-style games at D.C.’s brand new Escape Lounge , which opened in July on H Street NE. With roots in video game culture, escape rooms are cropping up in cities across the country. Aptly named, they are essentially rooms that you have to escape by answering clues, solving riddles, or finding hints that lead you to the key. They’ve become somewhat of a thing in the city in the past year, as WAMU noted last month , making the Escape Lounge the third to open since October. \n \nThis particular game lounge is also getting attention for having the city’s first escape room game set in the White House—though co-founder Ayanna Smith says that wasn’t the original intention. Smith, her husband, and their business partner wanted to launch a family entertainment business and, upon learning about escape rooms, decided to start the kid-friendly 30-minute-long Escape the Classroom game. They opened Escape the Oval Office at the same time, though, and it quickly become the main attraction. \n \n“The Oval Office is a little more popular now, because of the D.C. theme,” Smith says, adding that she’s noticed it’s an especially popular theme for tourists wanting to making their vacation as D.C.-centric as possible. \n \nEscape the Oval Office is a little bit different than some of the other escape rooms around town, which Smith warns visitors should know in advance. Rather than a linear style of play—where Clue #1 takes you to Clue #2, and so on, down a numbered list of clues—the Oval Office offers a lot of repeated clues in different locations around the office to help you find that missing piece from the president’s speech. \n \nAt first, this was hard for Washingtonians to grasp. Rare was the team that actually completed the puzzle and escaped the room, which led to some serious frustration in the Escape Lounge’s first weeks. Though Smith says that escape rooms “take a lot of pride in low escape numbers,” she acknowledged that frustration, especially among the competitive types these games attract. So in the past month, the Escape Lounge has started ramping up the last-minute hints the staff offers players. Now, about 50 percent of players escape before the end of the hour-long Escape the Oval Office game. \n \nEven if you do escape, these rooms are designed to allow you to come back for more. Every few months or so, The Escape Lounge intends to change up the scenario of both Escape the Oval Office and Escape the Classroom—keeping the themes, but changing the hints and the key needed to exit. \n \nBoth themed games are offered Wednesday to Sunday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; it's $25 per person. Smith says Escape the Oval Office books up quickly for its weekend sessions, so get a jump on those reservations. Each game is meant to be played with five to 10 people, so if your group is smaller you might find yourself escaping the room with strangers. Given the popularity these games have as team-building exercises, though, those strangers might be new friends by the time you get out. \n \nAmy McKeever is on the D.C. beat for Travel + Leisure .

36349778-9942-475d-bdf2-23b7372911c1	Lying hypocrites beg for votes from the misinformed and unenlightened  \n\nBy John Kaminski \n \nhttp://renegadetribune.com/author/kaminski/ \n \nhttp://therebel.is/kaminski \n \nAnyone who runs for president of the United States must supervise the robbery and murder of innocent countries, promise to maintain the unjust slave system of the international bankers, and lie about everything that pertains to the safety of the American people, because there is no safety for anyone in these desperate times as long as Jewish controlled puppets continue to wreak havoc on the entire world. \n \nAmong the hundreds of delusional demagogues who have run for president over the years, the most pathetic scene I ever witnessed personally was in the 2012 race when a large crowd of white-haired retirees gathered at Sarasota airport to enthusiastically welcome Minnesota Rep. Michelle Bachman, a pro-Israel shill who was later ridiculed for both her use of anti-depressants and her unflinching support for the international bankers who have deliberately sabotaged the American economy for more than a hundred years. \n \nThey loved her because she told them what they wanted to hear, and what she told them and what they wanted to hear was nothing but a garbled rant about American supremacy and the necessity to pay down the debt before any other money was ever spent. Some of us know now that the debt can never be paid off, which is the essence of the Jewish swindle of the whole world. \n \nHow could anybody with a brain have ever supported such a facile, drug-addled ignoramus as Bachman, who recently said the only way to avoid war with Iran is to bomb it? But it happens every election, with homicidal crazies urging war on the world to counter false flag threats that have been cynically engineered by the CIA and Mossad. Thanks to a war-mongering media run by the same money men who sell the weapons and commit the colossal crimes, Americans never learn. \n \nBut just as scary as the bizarre also-rans of history is the list of the people who have actually won presidential elections. Consider in recent years the immoral Bill Clinton, who gave America’s jobs away; George Bush the Younger, who was so dim-witted he had to be left out of the plot to wreck the World Trade Center lest through his stupidity he accidentally revealed the secret Jewish plan; and Barack Obama, who has no verifiable history at all except a suspicious trail of dead homosexual friends and a wife with a male physiognomy. \n \nSo I guess we shouldn’t be too surprised at the sudden emergence of megalomillionaire Donald Trump as the leader of this year’s pack. He has done what other early leaders have always done, told people exactly what they want to hear. \n \nThe dark side of this autumn romance, however, is that he is exactly like all the other would-be tyrant candidates — a diehard supporter of Israel, a great believer in a strong military, and a solid supporter of all the financial chicanery that has mired America in its deteriorating economic quagmire. Perhaps Trump’s expertise in the art of bankruptcy will provide a timely skill for the nation’s current and deepening depression. \n \nBut all of these observations are incidental. The facts on the ground are that none of the current candidates shows any indication of tempering the criminal policies of U.S. aggression against Israel’s enemies, or of addressing the intrinsically unfair policies of the Jewish central bankers who have fleeced America and the world since Woodrow Wilson promised to keep us out of World War I. \n \nAll the candidates show not a whit of genuine concern for the American people, but only obedience to the Jewish financial powers that make their candidacies possible. \n \nThen again, it seems to make a weird kind of sense that the candidates don’t display any verifiable competence and the electorate is predominantly out to lunch. It’s a perfect match. Fake leaders for fake people. From this match made in hell, nothing but further catastrophe can result. \n \n••• \n \nYour life is a lie, and the lives of your children are lies, based upon what you have told them about the way the world works, and how their futures will unfold. \n \nYou based your life on the lies you learned from your parents, received in school, and gleaned from the media and your friends, who have all been immersed in a sea of misinformation throughout their lives. \n \nBut now the grim fairy tales you have erected to justify your exploitation of the less fortunate of the world are beginning to crumble. The word bounceback has never been more apropos. The law of karma inflicts its deadly reward in the mirrored reflex of savages mimicking the heartless interlopers who have plundered them, desperate savages who now overwhelm the countries that have exploited them in the past. \n \nAnything goes, and money is all that matters. And on that day when the money is worth nothing, the world will implode. \n \nAnything that can be saved can also be stolen, as today’s Europeans are learning at their peril. \n \nEurope and America are about to be overrun by hungry slaves. Nothing can stop them, especially since the government is helping displace its own loyal citizens in a plot too wrenchingly macabre to even begin to comprehend. \n \nHow does it come to be that many of the refugees subjecting themselves to hardship and fleeing their war-torn homelands have thousands of dollars in their pockets, money which supposedly comes from American sources? How were these refugees able to pay the thousands of dollars for their precarious sea voyages from Turkey to some forlorn Mediterranean shore. \n \nPrecious few of us are strong enough, at least when we’re young, to discern between the truth and the lie, between the stark unadorned reality that nonplusses us and the fanciful fairy tale that beguiles us. More importantly, the young fail to realize that what we do to others inevitably comes back to haunt us. \n \nSo we get our news from the newspapers, or today the TV news, which, rather than being purveyors of the actual facts of the world, are rather the curators of the perpetual lies of the world, and in our reading of the news we become like those who have manipulated us always wanted us to become, namely, heartless killers, interested only in our own prospective fortunes. \n \nForced to defend our lives and our property, we will fight. And the Jews will have won, deploying their police to quell the unreasonable unrest. \n \nThe financial engine of the United States runs on killing people every day, which our candidates conveniently ignore as they prattle on about national security and the need to pay down a national debt that can never be repaid. \n \nWe have been taught to believe so many false things put forth by our fake media that we can’t hope to even discern what a genuinely altruistic candidate would actually say. We have been so convinced of the necessity of the income tax and the inevitability of inflation that we can no longer grasp the reality that existed in America for more than a hundred years that neither of these parasitic practices existed, and for a century inflation did not occur. \n \nWe listen to our doctors and the people in control of our children who swear on a stack of Bibles that what they’re doing is best for us, then react in tearful silence as our kids are returned to us at the end of the school day either half dead or totally deformed because of the medicines they were forced to take or the appalling lessons they were compelled to learn (like showing homosexual techniques to first graders to properly prepare them for molestation). \n \nThe one essential gauge that will indicate America is on the road to realism will be that one landmark day when we finally decided to address the festering lie of the 9/11 coverup. Until that happens we will continue on the road to ruin until America and the human race will run out of time, which will happen when we run out of air, which will happen a lot sooner than everyone thinks. \n \nFrom here on out, no person who refuses to address and overturn the lies that were told on September 11, 2001 can ever be a legitimate president of the United States. All those running now are merely cardboard cutouts furnished by the kosher tyrants who control our lives. They are all guaranteed to do nothing to improve our lives, only to fleece us thoroughly before harvesting our organs. \n \nThe savage rabble that now overruns the so-called civilized world only delivers the required cosmic payment for the mutilation of their innocence, the rape of their cultures, and theft of their precious possessions. They are here to return the favors. \n \nIn a country that ignores hapless victims of gratuitous violence lying in the street bleeding, one should not expect a functional response to one’s own misery and pain. That no candidate can realistically promise relief from our misery further indicates that whatever our presidential hopefuls are saying is merely meaningless rhetoric from the insane asylum our society has become. \n \nDonald Trump is a specialist in bankruptcy and casinos, which tells us a lot about the future he would guide us toward. Owner of golf courses and beauty contests, his television show featured his ability to fire people in an insulting way. The bottom line is that he has even been fired as boss of his own casinos and the people who invested in those casinos have lost 99 percent of their investments, according to CNN. \n \nI think it’s a fair rule of thumb that to vote for Donald Trump — or for that matter any of the announced candidates — that you will lose 99 percent of your investment. \n \nAnother loser trying to end her unemployment with a stint in the White House is Carly Fiorina, who was fired as president of Hewlett Packard after being labeled as one of the worst technology CEOs of all time. \n \nThen there’s Ben Carson, the vaunted neurosurgeon who advocates forced vaccinations despite the poisons in them. I’d mention the other Republican candidates but you could do better picking names at random out of the pages of a big city telephone book. \n \nAgainst this lineup of moribund Republicans, the Democrats counter with Bernie Sanders, an acknowledged Communist, and the old hag Hillary Clinton, who like so many other current American politicians, admittedly most of them Democrats, really ought to be serving life in prison for treason. \n \nEvery one of these brittle personas have their own quaint fairy tales about what is wrong with the U.S. government, but like the people whose votes they pursue, they all fail to understand the words of the philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti, who once said: \n \nIt is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. \n \nTo cast your vote for any one of these announced candidates is to reveal your own blind psychopathology for all to see, assuming there is anybody left who actually can see in this fetid swamp of fake people known as the American populace. \n \nJohn Kaminski is a writer who lives on the Gulf Coast of Florida, constantly trying to figure out why we are destroying ourselves, and pinpointing a corrupt belief system as the engine of our demise.

5e7a035e-3a52-4133-afb7-564423d6b1b0	Stu Waring's bike-fitting area in the back of Parvilla Cycle & Multisport could be confused with a doctor's office or a physical therapy center. \n\nThere's a skeleton. There's a foldup massage table. And then there's Waring, guiding his clients through an array of movements while discussing the health of their body. \n\nBut Waring isn't a doctor or a physical therapist. He's a bike fitter, who adjusts bikes by discovering riders' best possible position on the cycle for comfort and speed. \n\nIt's Waring and this back area that has made Parvilla Cycle & Multisport a premier bike shop on the East Coast. After just four years in operation, the store has been ranked one of the top 50 bike shops in the country by Active Times and was one of six nominated for best pro road shop in the nation by Interbike Awards. \n\n"This is the store," said Waring, who started the shop with Iain Banks. "Fitting is our store and why we are doing as well as we are four years into a brand-new business." \n\nWhile the store has garnered a strong local presence for its bikes and accessories, riders from around the country flock to the shop to get a fitting. Waring and his colleagues said he is typically booked about four weeks in advance for his fittings. \n\nHe does one fitting a day Monday through Friday. Each one takes about four hours and costs $350 for the standard package and $500 for the premium. \n\n"1/8Waring's3/8 one of the best fitters on the East Coast, so that brings in a broader range of customers," service manager Joseph Sikorski said. \n\nBike fitting wasn't Waring's first job, though. He got his degree in naval architecture and spent about 20 years in the industry, but he later got his fitting education through Retul, which is based in Boulder, Colo. \n\nHe has since become an instructor for the company and is its only fitter on the East Coast. Waring brings his engineering background to help his understanding of bikes, but he also enjoys studying the body and said he has picked up on things from chiropractors and physical therapists. \n\nIt's Waring's blend of the two aspects that allows him to best suit his clients. He can tell when customers need to correct their back problems, but rather than do it himself, he recommends them to a specialist and then has them come back once they are healthy. \n\n"There are fitters out there that will make the computer look good," Waring said. "They'll work the numbers and do all kinds of stuff and it looks good on the screen, but they get out there and they are jacked. The problem is it's the hips or the knees. They don't know enough or care enough about the body." \n\nThat's where Waring looks to set himself apart. And once he has a healthy client, he is able to turn to his machinery and knowledge to help improve a person's position on a bike. \n\nSituated in the back room, Waring has a "Guru Dynamic Fit Unit," which amounts to being a machine bike that is adjustable. Waring said he has used it roughly 2,000 times and credits it for generating about $350,000 a year, thus deeming it his "printing press." \n\nSurrounded by TV monitors, the machine allows Waring to adjust his client's position on the bike while still riding instead of having to manually change the bike over and over until the correct spot is found. \n\nHis background and equipment recently helped get an individual with cancer in his neck into a position where he can ride. He was previously having trouble looking up because of his limited mobility, but his position has changed that and he asked Waring whether he could go for a ride to coach him. \n\nWaring doesn't coach anymore, but instead, he plans on just enjoying a nice day with him. \n\n"We are just going to go and have a coffee and have a ride some time," Waring said. "I get a kick out of that. That, to me, is what it's all about." \n\nIt's that family attitude, beyond just the fitting, that has helped build the store, the employees said. \n\nBanks' wife, Sarah, who co-owns the store with Waring, said it comes down to knowing customers' names and chatting with them when they stop by. \n\n"We are able to cater to everyone at the same time, whether it is someone getting into it or someone that wants a $20,000 bike," Sikorski said. "We treat everyone the same. We are small group of people. We are like a family." \n\nThe store holds weekly rides that allow it to not only grow a customer base, but also build a community around the store. On Mondays, it offers about a 20-mile co-ed bike ride that leaves from the store. Then Wednesdays, it has a ladies-only ride followed by a barbecue. \n\n"It brings more people to the area," Sikorski said. "It's a friendly atmosphere, just everyone hanging out having a hot dog and a beer." \n\nBanks said he and Waring set out to make the business something different to separate it from other independent bike stores. Waring and his bike fitting has done that for Parvilla. \n\nBut there is more to the store than just that back room. Bikes line the wall, helmets rest on shelves, and now there's also triathlon equipment. \n\nThe bike fitting might be the main revenue stream and what draws outsiders in, but Parvilla Cycle & Multisport prides itself on everything else it offers the community, too. \n\n"As much as we still do the high-end, custom, niche items, we are still that neighborhood bike store as well," Banks said. "We will still work on everybody's bike."

693ae030-4239-4291-b248-dbf7c1696ff2	Georgia is set to execute its only woman on death row Tuesday evening. If all goes according to the state’s plan, Kelly Gissendaner will be the first woman the state has executed in 70 years. She was sentenced to death in 1998 for plotting the death of her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, with her boyfriend. \n \nGissendaner drove her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, to her house, gave him the murder weapons — a nightstick and a hunting knife — and then went to a nightclub with friends, according to court documents. Owen ambushed Douglas and forced him to drive his car to a remote location that Gissendaner chose beforehand. \n \nOnce they arrived, Owen beat Douglas and stabbed him. Owen took Douglas’s wedding ring and watch to make it look like a robbery. Gissendaner later arrived at the scene and helped her boyfriend burn her husband’s body and car. Law enforcement was unable to find Douglas’s body for weeks. \n   \nOwen accepted a plea deal and testified against Gissendaner. In exchange, he received a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Gissendaner refused to take a plea and lost when she went to trial. \n \nAs Gissendaner’s execution date nears, two of her and Douglas’s children are calling for her life to be spared. \n   “We’ve lost our dad. We can’t imagine losing our mom too,” daughter Kayla Gissendaner said.  \n youtube.com \n   \nIn response, Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it was “manipulation.” \n \n“The case began with manipulation by Kelly Gissendaner and it appears it will end with manipulation by Kelly Gissendaner,” he said, adding that Douglas’s parents have wanted the execution to go forward. \n \nOn Monday, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles announced that it will meet on Tuesday to “receive and consider supplemental information” about the case. Previously, the board had denied clemency. The board has the option to allow the denial of clemency to stay, to grant a stay of up to 90 days, or to grant clemency. The board has the sole authority to grant clemency in Georgia. \n \nThis is the third time the state has set an execution date for Gissendaner. The first time, it was called off because of the weather. The second time, it was called off after the execution drugs were found to have particles floating in them. \n           \nView this image › \n  \nGeorgia’s pentobarbital on the date it was scheduled to be used.  Georgia Department of Corrections \n   \nGeorgia, like some other death penalty states, obtains its execution drugs from a compounding pharmacy that mixes the drug up in secret. \n \nThe state concluded that the likeliest cause was that the drugs were stored at too cold of a temperature, although its expert floated the possibility that there was a problem with how it was mixed, and the state attempted to withhold test results that disagreed with its narrative. \n \nGissendaner’s attorneys argued that the hours she waited not knowing if the “cloudy” drugs would be used on her amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, and that it showed the state was likely to use questionable drugs on her in the future. \n \nBut U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash disagreed, finding that the state “did not intentionally subject [her] to uncertainty for the sake of inflicting more pain upon her.” \n \n“It is not enough to show that the State may obtain defective lethal injection drugs,” the judge wrote when he dismissed the case in August. Gissendaner “must show that there is a substantial risk that the defective drugs will be used on” her in the future. \n \nHe added that “if anything, the March 2 incident shows that the state is unlikely to use defective drugs on” her. \n \nGissendaner asked him to reconsider his ruling, which the judge declined to do. On Monday, Gissendaner notified the court that she was appealing the decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. \n \nGeorgia intends to use compounded drugs again, but this time plans on storing the drugs in a new refrigeration unit to regulate its temperature. \n \nGissendaner also has a petition at the Supreme Court seeking a stay of execution based on her claim that prison officials violated her rights by having “thwarted” the clemency process. \n \nClaiming that officials “actively frustrated the [clemency] procedures established by Georgia law,” Gissendaner’s lawyers write that such actions violated her constitutional due process rights. \n   \nCheck out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!
f18bbd65-57a4-414a-b78b-356b9ecb65f0	A poker player attacked and murdered the close friend of his former girlfriend's suspected lover, a court has heard. A poker player attacked and murdered the close friend of his former girlfriend's suspected lover, a court has heard. Crown prosecutor Tom Gyorffy, QC, told a Supreme Court jury on Wednesday that Collin Thomas became angry when George Anagnostellis refused to tell him where he could find his love rival.\n\nMr Gyorffy said Mr Thomas attacked Mr Anagnostellis, who was separated from his wife and living at his parents' home in Malvern East, before setting fire to the garage on April 11, 2014.\n\nMr Thomas has pleaded not guilty to one count of murder and one count of arson.\n\nMr Gyorffy said that at the time of his death, Mr Anagnostellis was an avid poker player who played and organised poker tournaments at local hotels.\n\nThe prosecutor described Mr Anagnostellis as a gentle man who was never violent or threatening to anyone.\n\nMr Gyorffy said Mr Thomas and his girlfriend, Tina Thwaites, who were both poker players, had been in a relationship for about a year when Ms Thwaites ended it some time before the alleged murder.\n\n"Mr Thomas believed that she'd been having an affair with another poker player, Mr Billy Theoharis, and he was angry about that," the prosecutor told the jury.\n\n"He was trying to track him (Mr Theoharis) down and was texting and calling his phone.\n\n"Mr Theoharis was a good friend of the deceased man (Mr Anagnostellis)."\n\nAfter playing poker at the Sandown Hotel, Mr Anagnostellis invited Mr Thomas, Andrew Heke and Scott Sullivan back to his parents' Malvern East home just after 1am on April 11.\n\nThe men went into the garage and sat around a table playing cards and drinking home-made ouzo and wine.\n\nBy 4.30am, Mr Sullivan became unwell and left the garage in a severely intoxicated state and was later picked up by his partner. Mr Heke was asleep at the table when Mr Sullivan left.\n\nMr Thomas then allegedly confronted Mr Anagnostellis about where he could find Mr Theoharis.\n\nMr Thomas later told police he assaulted Mr Anagnostellis about 20 to 30 times involving "a mixture of punches, elbows, kicks, knees, head butts" to the face, head and body.\n\n"It's a bit of a blur," Mr Thomas told police.\n\n"I'm not really too sure about how that went down. All I remember is getting to the point where I obviously felt angry enough to assault him.\n\n"I was just not getting anywhere and just getting sandbagged and basically being treated like an idiot, like I didn't know anything. I wasn't getting the information, obviously, that I was after and I was getting frustrated."\n\nMr Thomas wanted to find Mr Theoharis because there were accusations he had "slept with my girlfriend (Ms Thwaites) at the time" in late 2013.\n\nMr Gyorffy said Mr Anagnostellis suffered a number of serious head and neck injuries from the beating which led to his death.\n\n"The Crown says Mr Thomas then poured petrol on the floor and over Mr Anagnostellis' body and set it alight before he left the scene."\n\nDefence barrister Colin Mandy told the jury Mr Thomas did not deny assaulting Mr Thomas but claimed the last time he saw him he was alive and about to set fire to himself and the garage.\n\n"He (Mr Thomas) told the police that he dragged Andrew Heke out of there and was blown out of the door by the explosion that happened," Mr Mandy said.\n\nThe trial, before Justice Jack Forrest, continues. The story first appeared on The Age.

9c72b6ec-8f72-4914-8ca1-21935e1e2986	The man shot dead by police last week outside his Texas home had hit one of the officers with the butt end of a knife, the lawyer for the family of Gilbert Flores said Thursday. \n\nBut Thomas Henry said experts the family has working on the case have "serious concerns" about whether Flores was an imminent threat to two Bexar County deputies who had their handguns pointed at him and shot him. \n\nIf the threat was gone, he said, "you can no longer use deadly force." \n\nHenry said Flores had a knife in his hand as police officers investigated a domestic disturbance call at the family's San Antonio home. Flores' wife had been injured earlier and the 911 call was warranted, Henry said. But Flores hadn't used a knife against her, the attorney added. \n\nHenry also said a report that a baby had been injured was inaccurate. \n\nThe lawyer said he has yet to see a second video that also shows Flores' interaction with police and the moment he was shot. Authorities have not released the video to the media or public. \n\nA video that was posted online Monday by CNN affiliate KSAT shows Flores raising his arms as he stands in front of the officers. In that video, shot by a passing motorist, Flores' left arm is obscured by a pole. \n\nThe first video provides a stark, long-distance view of Flores. The second video is longer and is recorded from a different angle than the cell phone video that has been shown by the news media, Bexar County Sheriff Susan Pamerleau said Wednesday. \n\nThe sheriff said the video shows Flores with "something in his hand." \n\n"We believe it was a knife," Pamerleau told reporters. \n\nThe video, recorded by a neighbor, shows suspect Gilbert Flores acting "wildly aggressive," a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. The footage also shows the suspect charging one officer with a knife at one point and also shoving chairs at an officer, the source said. \n\nAuthorities have declined to comment on whether they found a knife at the scene. \n\nThe deputies, who are on administrative leave, are Greg Vasquez and Robert Sanchez, the sheriff's office has said. \n\nCNN's efforts to contact them have so far been unsuccessful. \n\nEach has been with the sheriff's office for more than a decade, Pamerleau said. Neither deputy involved in the shooting was wearing a body camera. \n\nFlores had previous run-ins with the law. He was cited for possession of marijuana in 1995, criminal trespassing and aggravated assault in 1999, and aggravated robbery in 2003. \n\nThe incident comes at a time when law enforcement officers are under scrutiny for how and when they resort to lethal force. The killings of several people by police over the past year have heightened tensions with the communities they serve, especially among minorities.

It is an attempt to allow people to tell their personal stories, in the hopes of bringing greater compassion to the unique issues each of us face. If you would like to submit a story to this series, click here.  Today’s guest post is by Charity Craig. \nOnly minutes after my mother-in-law arrived, there was a knock at the door. She returned, “there’s an officer here to serve you your divorce papers”. The words were the final nail in the coffin. It was over. My marriage was dead. There was nothing left for me to do, but let go, so I did. I began to sob and my mother-in-law just held me. Since I couldn’t pull myself together and the officer wanted to jet all the awkwardness, he served the papers to my mother-in-law. For the first time in my life, I fought for something, and I lost. Exhausted and depleted, I slipped the papers into my top drawer and took off my ring. I would deal with that tomorrow. I felt betrayed even by God. Didn’t he see how hard I had fought for the right thing? Now I had lost everything and didn’t see how he could ever turn something like this into good. I see and know what divorces do to families with children. In a brief moment, in my mind’s eye, it was like the shroud that hides my future was lifted and I could see down the tunnel of my life. An inaudible voice spoke to my heart, “Your good and perfect gift is eternal and I have it waiting for you, but until then you must walk this broken road”. Just like that, my dependence switched from Matt to Christ. Just like that, I gave up the fight to control. So, three days later when the shell of my husband showed up at the door and said he wanted to come back and give us a try, he met a different person. I was done fighting. It was over. He looked at me and said, “I’m sorry I never fought for us. I’m sorry I made you do it alone. You don’t need to fight anymore. I will”. The next several months he did fight, and we began to inch our ways back into the same room of life. I was determined not to put a Jesus Band-aid on the wounds, and Matt gave me permission to hurt. Standing across from Matt I lowered my shield and let him see my bleeding heart. Then, Matt lowered his shield and I was shocked to discover I wasn’t the only one in the room with a mortally wounded heart. Suddenly, “you need to pay for what you did” lost its punch. Over the next year, we’ve learned to take more risks with our own hearts, but be more tender with each other’s. We’ve practiced saying, “I forgive you” and “I love you” to each other and ourselves. This past weekend we celebrated our 10-year anniversary. We stayed in the nicest suite one night could buy here in town, and after enjoying free food and drinks in the concierge lounge we wandered down to the lobby lounge where Tom was singing classic songs. Matt gave a request and as Tom began to sing, Georgia on My Mind, Matt did the one thing he knew I’ve always longed to do; Matt pulled me up and danced with me while no one else danced. As Matt held me close, my heart was full. Tom finished his tune, thanked us for dancing, and then he said, “Let’s applaud this couple. That’s a couple in love”. Suddenly, everyone was applauding and looking at us. But what no one in that lounge realized, they were really applauding proof that there’s life after death.

0a74a914-54fb-47bc-acae-5dcd10ed5c3d	Feast of St. Matthew, Apostle, Evangelist   REACHING OUT TO THE UNCHURCHED   “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” – Matthew 9:11   At The Feast (the weekly prayer gathering of the Light of Jesus Family), we welcome everyone — the holy, the broken, and all sorts of people that Jesus used to minister to in His days. In fact, Bo Sanchez, The Feast founder, intended it to be a place where the “unchurched” can experience God’s love for them. That’s why it’s held in commercial places such as mall cinemas.        Through the testimonies that I, as managing editor of Kerygma magazine, have been receiving from Feast attendees, I can say that, truly, God is using it to extend His love to the people who are away from Him.        An example is Faye, a practicing lesbian then, who is now happily married to a man and is serving God through one of Bo’s media ministries. The unconditional love she received from a caring group at The Feast made her see her true identity as a daughter of God.        Jesus’ style. Pope Francis’s style. Bo’s The Feast style.        They all seem to work in bringing people back to God.        What’s your style? Tess V. Atienza (theresa.a@shepherdsvoice.com.ph)   Reflection: Who brought you closer to God? Say a prayer for him or her now.   Dear Jesus, thank You for showing us the way to love others, regardless of their past. Use me more to love and serve Your broken people.   St. Matthew, Apostle and Evangelist, pray for us.
8232e1c2-f5f2-4b86-88d0-4ec5a420dced	AN Oxfordshire mother whose twins survived premature birth has backed a national Stand Up for Tiny Lives Campaign. \n \nGail Laing's two girls, Sophie and Emily, are now 11 years old and are leading normal and healthy lives. \n \nAt the time of their birth, Mrs Laing did not know premature birth was the single biggest cause of death among babies in this country. \n \nBut she is now hoping people across Oxfordshire will support a call by the charity Action Medical Research for an independent inquiry into why some babies are born so early. \n \nThe campaign, backed by leading scientists and researchers, aims to get support and funding for more research into premature births. It has already raised more than £3m. \n \nMrs Laing, a former paediatrics specialist, and her husband Michael, an officer in the RAF, live with their children in Carterton. \n \nSophie and Emily were born at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital, weighing just 3lb 13oz and 3lb 6oz. \n \nMrs Laing said: "They were whisked straight away into special care and after 10 days recovery I went home without them, which felt weird. \n \n"My husband and I felt so very helpless.

8d8a6a7e-26c6-40e1-a651-b9517f9c6f5a	When Lightening Strikes.Via Sheri Gaynoron Sep 22, 2015\tMy sentinels—our communal horses—were restless, pacing the pasture side-by-side, stopping every so often, ears forward, heads high, to look northeast, toward the mountains in the far distance. Here in Northern California, we’d had a stretch of triple digit temperatures, with no relief in sight. Last Saturday by late afternoon the air was hot, dry and charged with static, and a strange wild, wind kicked up out of nowhere. The fire energy was palpable. The next day we got the news: Lake County was burning and it was bad. As the reports come in of the enormous devastation, I’ve felt completely helpless. Lost houses, lost lives, lost pets. Desperate pleas on Facebook posts with photos and telephone numbers, seeking word of loved ones, animals and any updates about homes and neighborhoods. Today I was finally able to help in some small way by delivering much needed supplies for horses and livestock to the Fairgrounds. What I witnessed stunned me. What you’re not seeing in the media reports are the hundreds of tents that are currently set up outside the Napa Fairgrounds, housing families and animals of all kinds. Think mini-Katrina with livestock and assorted four-leggeds. As someone who survived a fire evacuation in 1994 in Colorado, the Storm King Fire, one worst fires in history, the one that apparently, “wrote the manual” for firefighting going forward—14 firefighters lost their lives, trying to save our community—I understand first hand what it feels like to wonder if you have seen the last of your home, your pets and your possessions. The words anxiety and grief don’t cover it. I was living in a log cabin surrounded by BLM wilderness, when fire season started that summer—an annual and inevitable event. I made a list of things I would take with me in case a fire broke out. I don’t know why I did that; I’d never done it before. I set it on my desktop, so I wouldn’t have to “think” about it if the time came. When it came down to it, there were only five things on that list, all of them deeply personal and of enormous sentimental value. It’s interesting when it comes right down to it what’s important to us, really. Shortly after writing the list, I left Colorado to attend my grandmother’s funeral in Florida. It was literally during her ceremony when the phone started vibrating off the hook. My heart started to pound; I knew something was terribly wrong. The phone rang again, I looked down and saw my husband’s number, I left the funeral parlor and walked outside, relieved to know he was alive, “I don’t want you to worry, I’m fine and I have the dog, the fire has exploded, we’ve been evacuated, I took what I could.” The words hit me like a Mac truck. It started from a lightening strike, initially burning only three acres. When it touched down, it found exactly what it needed to grow and spread. By the time it overran the fire line jumping the highway and the riverbed, it had trapped and killed 14 courageous men and women and engulfed one side of our town. It was 4 days after that initial strike that the fire began climbing the hillside behind our home. As he sat in his truck out of harms way, on the other side of town, my husband described orange-red flames shooting 100 feet in the air licking the top of the ridgeline, above our home. That’s the trouble with fire. It doesn’t stay put. It’s a moving target and the laws of nature will take it where it wants to go. I still have no idea how those men and women stopped that fire where they did. When I returned home to see the fires path and the charred remains of homes, trees and the land, it seemed nothing short of a miracle. There are really no words that can accurately describe the feelings of gratitude I have for those who put their lives on the line every day in this way. We were lucky that year, “spared,” we were told, but somehow, you don’t feel that way, when you carry in your heart the weight of 14 lives and so many others—friends and neighbors—who weren’t as “fortunate.” As I drove home after dropping off the donations, I had time to process what I witnessed at the Fairgrounds, Revisiting the tents, tarps and mountains of donated clothing, in my minds eye, it hit me again: life can change in an instant. And then last night the rains came. On any other day it would have been cause for huge celebration. The water so critically needed, yet under the circumstances so brutal and unfair. These folks have been through so much, they didn’t need to spend a cold, wet night outside. It’s not a small thing to become homeless overnight and lose everything you’ve treasured, your livelihood…and your beloved pets. This is the definition of trauma.\nAs I head back to the fairgrounds to offer support, I am counting my blessings and grappling with the duality of life.

9b28e780-ba48-4a53-8682-7c58c141a1b6	NEW YORK -- Theatergoers who check out "Beautiful" on tour won't get to see Tony winner Jessie Mueller but they may get the next best thing -- someone with her DNA. \n\nMueller's older sister Abby has stepped into her sister's shoes to play Carole King in the Broadway musical about the celebrated "I Feel the Earth Move" songwriter. \n\nAbby Mueller acknowledged she was "a little hesitant" to audition for a part that earned her sister a best-actress Tony Award last year. \n\n"I'm really glad my agent convinced me to and I'm really glad they saw something in me. I've just been having the best time doing this," said Abby Mueller. "As soon as I got the audition, I called Jessie. I was like, 'I've got a funny story for you.'" \n\nJessie and Abby Mueller are just the tip of the talented, Chicago-based Mueller family. Their brothers, Matt and Andrew, as well as their parents, Roger Mueller and Jill Shellabarger, are all actors. \n\n"Beautiful" director Marc Bruni said Abby, who graduated from Indiana University and has been on Broadway in "Kinky Boots," earned the job with her skills. \n\n"We did not set out to specifically cast within the Mueller family. Abby is an extraordinary talent in her own right," he said. \n\n"She is creating her own version of Carole that has all of the emotional resonance and all of the truthful acting that comes with the Mueller family and their amazing accessibility of emotion." \n\nThe tour kicks off in Providence, Rhode Island, on Tuesday. It makes stops in North Carolina, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Texas, California and Colorado. \n\nOne of the tour's highlights for Mueller will be spending the holidays and New Year's Eve in Chicago. "It's going to be awesome. I'm thrilled," she said. "I haven't been home for Christmas in years." \n\nThe musical tells the story of King and her first husband, Gerry Goffin, who together composed some of the greatest pop singles of the early 1960s, including The Shirelles' "Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow," the Drifters' "Up on the Roof," Bobby Vee's "Take Good Care of My Baby" and Little Eva's "The Loco-Motion." \n\nBook writer Douglas McGrath intertwines the story of King and Goffin with that of their friends and avid competitors, the songwriting team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, which opens another treasure trove of pop hits like "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" and "Walking in the Rain." \n\nAudience members get some history -- and some killer tunes. "You learn something and you have your heart warmed. And you also have this catalog of music that is just unparalleled," said Bruni. \n\nIt will be the first time on the road for Mueller, but not for Liam Tobin, who plays Gerry Goffin. The Canadian-born Tobin toured western Europe in "West Side Story." \n\nHe didn't see the Broadway version until after starting tour rehearsals and said he loves digging into a character who struggles with mental illness and guilt. \n\n"It's been a real treat to go somewhere else with a character than just your classic leading man," he said. "It's really a privilege to really dig in to something like Gerry." \n\nMueller, who grew up listening to King's landmark album "Tapestry" and recently met the songwriter, has been trying to tap into King's honesty and vulnerability. \n\n"Trying to do anything to be like Carole is instantly going to ring false," she said. "Hopefully, when you're going for that truth and honesty, those are the essence that made people love Carole and hopefully that essence is what's going to carry the show." \n\n___ \n\nOnline: \n\nhttp://beautifulonbroadway.com/tour \n\n___ \n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwitsOnline

With no health history on these individuals, it is critical HIX plans are doing what they can to get their members connected to primary care and case management if needed. \n\nBy partnering with CenseoHealth, HIX plans are able to offer their members quality time with a physician at a location that is convenient for them. Members appreciate the thoroughness of the health assessment and recommendations. With the data collected from the assessment, health plans are then able to better understand the health needs of their members and assist them in navigating their care and recommended preventative services. \n\nSatisfaction with CenseoHealth health assessments is high. The following are testimonials from health plan members who have received a CenseoHealth's physician assessment: \n\n"I am a retired nurse and I never saw the point in scheduling these visits, but decided to give it a try. The physician diagnosed my husband with a heart problem and advised us to follow up with our primary care physician. When we visited with the doctor, he found the diagnosis to be correct. It is a serious condition and were it not for the CenseoHealth assessment, my husband probably wouldn't be here …
f56cc7a5-dd56-47a5-8318-4068bb8a1c9f	The action adventure “The Last Witch Hunter” starring “Fast and the Furious’” Vin Diesel takes on the legendary titular character of Kaulder, a guardian for an endless age, is all that stands between humanity and the combined forces of the most horrifying witches in history. \n \n“The Last Witch Hunter” sees armies of witch hunters who battled the unnatural enemy across the globe for centuries, including Kaulder, a valiant warrior who managed to slay the all-powerful Queen Witch, decimating her followers in the process. In the moments right before her death, the Queen curses Kaulder with her own immortality, forever separating him from his beloved wife and daughter in the afterlife. Today Kaulder is the only one of his kind remaining, and has spent centuries hunting down rogue witches, all the while yearning for his long-lost loved ones. However, unbeknownst to Kaulder, the Queen Witch is resurrected and seeks revenge on her killer causing an epic battle that will determine the survival of the human race. \n \n“The Last Witch Hunter” opens October 21 in (Phils.) cinemas from Pioneer Films. \n \n[embedded content] \n Conversations \ncomments
f69ff4d5-ebaf-4c85-a3c1-4f185887e57c	Pressing questions are always asked about my prime-time viewing: \nMy wife: “What network is ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ on?” I didn’t answer. Instead, I asked: “What\nbroadcast network did ‘The Mindy Project” air on?” She said: “NBC!”   \n\nIt’s a confusing media world for sure. \n\n“Mindy” was on Fox; now\nat Hulu; “Nine-Nine” is going into its third season on Fox, one of the few shows to grow its audience -- 4.87 million in its second season from 4.80 million viewers. So, who cares what\nnetwork it’s on? Branding, schmanding! \n\nOn the flip side, there are easy network brand associations: For many in my household, it can be easy to identify the content on networks like Food\nand Hallmark, but tough to identify specific shows. \n\nOver the weekend, I stumbled upon the team-time trial race at the World Road Cycling Championships in Richmond, Virginia -- not on NBCSN, the\nsports network-- but on CNBC, NBC’s business news network. I guess this make sense: This time of year I’m “cycling” in and out of stock investments in my\nportfolio. \n\nSeeing content in places you don’t expect? Not a trend. \n\nStill, NBC regularly uses many of its dozen or so cable networks when it has way too many Olympic events to cover.\nTurner airs plenty of NCAA Men’s basketball tournament games on its networks. Viacom recently aired the MTV “Video Music Awards” this year on many more of its cable networks. \n\nMuch of this makes economic sense, with networks looking to monetize increasingly expensive programming assets. \n\nSo with the start of the new season, does it matter that the average TV\nviewer might not associate new shows with their networks, like “Supergirl” and “The Muppets”? (“Supergirl” will be on CBS; “The Muppets,” ABC”). \n\nYes, you might say broadcasters can have a strong identify: CBS has lots of crime procedurals; ABC has racy and sharp dramas. \n\nYet in the future, established TV network brands might want\nto be a lot of more than they are.
9a95041a-90d6-43f1-b015-89e99437c452	All this month, the Sentinel has been highlighting good things about Central Florida with our "O-Mazing Orlando" feature. \n\nAnd as the paper's resident name-taker, I figured I should take — and share — a few names myself. \n\nSo for this installment of "Winning Wednesday," I wanted to highlight people who work tirelessly to make Central Florida a better place to live. Some are unsung heroes. Others are selfless advocates. All are fueled by passion. \n\nThis list has 10 people and organizations. But I could rattle off 10 times that many. Literally. After I took to social media to ask readers for their suggestions for unsung heroes, I received more than 100. \n\nThat alone speaks volumes about the community. \n\n• Andrea Eliscu , mentor and philanthropist. When Eliscu lost her husband to cancer 15 years ago, she had every reason to retreat from the world. Instead, she embraced it: helping underprivileged kids, women with cancer, aspiring medical students and more. Eliscu's most creative endeavor is probably her dragon-boat project, in which kids from Parramore team up with Orlando cops in rowing competitions, learning to row and work together. That effort alone was profiled recently on NBC's "Today" show. But she has also helped cancer survivors and helped fund a scholarship for the inaugural class of UCF med-school students … in her husband's honor. \n \n• David Odahowski and the Edyth Bush Charitable Foundation. It's hard to overstate the impact this foundation has on our community. We are talking donations of more than $100 million to more than 800 organizations — bolstering art and culture, promoting education, helping the destitute and more. The CEO, Odahowski, and his foundation do much of their work quietly but with widespread, impressive results. \n\n• Judy Sarullo of Pet Rescue by Judy. A lot of people have a passion for animals. Few turn that passion into a lifetime pursuit. More than 20 years ago, Judy started her crusade to find homes for unwanted animals in Seminole County. Since then, she has helped place pets all over Central Florida — a whopping 60,000 of them — which is why the Sentinel once described Judy as "patron saint of abandoned, abused and unwanted dogs and cats." \n  \n• Virtually every public defender. They are overworked, outmanned and underpaid. They are scoffed at by some of their rotten clients. They don't get the time they need to work on cases that truly need it, and yet they can be someone's only hope for justice. Their profession is both noble and inglorious. Frontline prosecutors are in similar boats. The balance of justice often rests with people who aren't making enough money to pay off their law-school loans. \n\n• The Rev. Bill Barnes . Barnes retired this year as senior pastor of St. Luke's United Methodist Church But he leaves behind a legacy that has both changed — and saved — lives. Barnes believed that no one should suffer because of a lack of health care. That belief led him to found Shepherd's Hope Ministries, which now provides 21,000 free patient visits each year in clinics throughout Orange and Seminole counties. The reins here have recently been taken over by CEO Marni Stahlman , who will carry on the legacy — which includes an impressive 1,800 volunteers. \n \n• Michelle Mangum , director of Seminole Work Opportunity Program for special-needs adults. Michelle's offices are anything but glamorous. They're housed in an old warehouse with a crumbling second floor in a remote part of Seminole County. But there, she presides over a haven and refuge. At SWOP, developmentally disabled adults get a chance to have a job and earn dignity — at the only facility of its kind in Central Florida. Mangum could make more money elsewhere, but it's hard to imagine she could make more of a difference. \n\n• Joy Wallace Dickinson . Yes, the Sentinel's Joy Wallace Dickinson. Loudmouth columnists such as I may generate more mail. But week in and week out, Joy provides a service like no one else in Central Florida: sharing the stories of Central Florida's history in her weekend "Florida Flashback" column. History is important in any community. But history- tellers are particularly important in a transient community such as ours. Joy continues to fill that role even after retiring from her full-time days here … and we should all be grateful for that. \n\n• Bob Kodzis , professional inspirer. I first profiled Bob, a leadership and team-building consultant, a few years back when he began his new life-work model of donating half of all his services to local charities. (The title of the piece: "He works one volunteer job for every paying one — and is richer for it.") Well, it's been three years. And Bob's "buy one, give one" lifestyle is still going strong, benefiting nonprofits throughout the region. \n\n• Lizette Valarino , fulfiller of college dreams. Many students can get accepted to college if they work hard enough. Not everyone can afford to go, though. That was the problem Valarino wanted to solve when she founded the Hispanic Heritage Scholarship Fund. Since she did so in 2000, the fund has provided scholarships to more than 200 students in Central Florida, transforming a whole lot of lives. \n\n• Donna Dowless , "Ambassador of Love" for the city of Orlando. Sure, the title — bestowed upon her by Mayor Buddy Dyer — may sound silly … until you meet Dowless and realize how genuine she is about promoting the upside of the City Beautiful. Dowless is a downtown artist with hip glasses and a cool coif who promotes and embraces all things Orlando and artistic. She's everywhere and all positive, all the time. There's a reason most of her artwork involves hearts. \n\nI have many more winning names to take — including Dr. Marvin Hardy , singer Mr. Richard , the leadership of Orange County's Legal Aid Society and more. \n\nTo learn more — or nominate unsung heroes of your own — visit OrlandoSentinel.com/takingnames . \n\nsmaxwell@tribpub.com \n Copyright © 2015, Orlando Sentinel
23490793-bb60-44c0-bbec-9c3be871d762	Will criminal Callum Logan survive Coronation Street's highly anticipated hour-long live special episode which goes out tonight? \n \n\t\t \nBookmaker William Hill has made the character, played by Sean Ward, the favourite to be killed off with odds of 1/8 on this outcome. \n  The Coronation Street live episode is part of ITV's 60th birthday celebrations (ITV/PA)   \n"Around 80% think Callum will be killed off tonight, but there is every chance that the current storyline is a double bluff," William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams said. \n\n\t\t\t \nT he Platt family are taking centre stage and the odds on David (Jack P Shepherd) dying are currently a 6/1 shot, while his half-sister Sarah-Louise (Tina O'Brien) and wife Kylie (Paula Lane) are both 8/1 to be bumped off. \n\n\n\n \nDuring the episode, which marks ITV's 60th birthday, the Platts are caught up in a war with violent, manipulative Callum, but Sarah-Louise runs into trouble when she takes him on; what will her ex-boyfriend do in retaliation? \n\nThis will be producer Stuart Blackburn's swansong as Emmerdale's current producer Kate Oates will soon take over ITV's biggest soap. \n\nBlackburn is leaving the role to work on other projects within ITV, but will remain at the helm for the live episode. \n\nIn the best tradition of Coronation Street, viewers are promised drama, comedy and tears. \n\n\t\t\t \n"At the heart of all this is going to be the Platts and their ongoing feud between the good guys - and whoever thought David Platt would be one of the good guys? - and Callum," Blackburn told the Radio Times. \n\n"It's going to be full of shocks and twists and really will make everything that has come before look like a prologue." \n\nThe live episode will also see a big secret revealed as Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine) is set to find out about the illicit kiss shared between fiancee Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) and her ex- husband Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell). \n\nThe on-air drama will be accompanied by a second screen experience as fans will be able to watch via their laptop, mobile or tablet as the episode is being made on itv.com and Facebook. \n\n\t\t\t \nThe stream is hosted by Stephen Mulhern, who is also presenting an after-show called Coronation Street Live: Uncovered on ITV2 at 10pm. \n\nBy the end of the ITV transmission, one viewer's tweet or Facebook message will be seen on the blackboard  in the famous Rovers Return pub. \n\nViewers will also be able to choose the music at the leaving party for Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) and Andrea Beckett (Hayley Tamaddon)  in an interactive poll on Facebook and Twitter. \n\nCoronation Street cast and crew will be hoping everything goes smoothly and that no-one repeats the mistake of EastEnders star Jo Joyner who,  as the BBC soap's Tanya Branning, called Albert Square's Ian Beale "Adam", the name of actor Adam Woodyatt during their live episode. \n\nCoronation Street's live episode airs tonight at 7.30pm on ITV. \n\n\t\t\t \n\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.

fc6ad33a-ae70-41ff-9f0e-7283f85878f6	Today I have a special guest on my blog.  \n \nBesides the great bloggers that I have asked to write a guest post for me all throughout the year (one per month), some have taken the first step and contacted me, gracefully asking if I would welcome a good article from them. \n \nBeing the busy woman that I am, writing some 10,000 words a week on average while traveling Europe, I am not someone who can easily say no to such offers.  \n \nSo, when Jonathan Spektor asked me if I would welcome a guest post of his, and I checked what he was doing, I say yes, right away. By the way, you should check him out too. \n \nSo, without further ado, take it away Jonathan… \n \nBlogging Secret. \n \nI have been selling products and services online for over 10 years now. \n \nI remember my first foray into online business. \n \nIt was in the early days of eBay. \n \nI would go to Rice’s flea market in New Hope, PA with my girlfriend, now wife and mother of two beautiful children.  We would go and buy beanie babies and other trinkets to list on eBay.  I made quite a bit of money for a college kid at the time. \n \nI had plenty of spending money for cheeseburgers and beer. \n \nOver the years, I started a number of online businesses.  They all made a little bit more money each time. \n \nBut online business and ecommerce have changed over the years.  With change I had to adapt. \n \n  \n Google Changed and we Followed  \nAbout 6 years ago, Google made some serious improvements to their search algorithms. \n \nGone were the days of keyword stuffing your Meta tags and having your site rank highly in search results.  Remember those days? \n \n\n \nBetween the keywords, a title and description with “Dog” you could rank for Dogs in no time.  How rudimentary that seems now. \n \nIt worked back then though. \n \nGoogle’s new search algorithm was different.  It was starting to take page content into account.   Google started checking for relevancy and quality of content. \n \nBy this time, my partner Bobby and I had realized we had to adapt our online businesses to this change. \n \nMost of our traffic was highly targeted to niche businesses.  We had focused on keywords based on the products or services that we were selling.  We based our domain names, product titles, and descriptions around the vertical we were targeting. \n \nBut this was no longer enough.  We had to start blogging. \n \n  \n Cold Hearted Ecommerce Blogging  \nWe realized we had to embrace blogging in a big way. \n \nOther sites were starting to rank for our search terms. \n \nSo we created blogs on our sites.  The idea was to create new, unique content, based around our verticals. \n \nWe would then capture people from related keyword searches.  Once on our site, we would draw them towards our primary sales goal. \n \nThe problem was that many of our sites were in verticals that we weren’t experts in.  We didn’t need incredible content, but didn’t want to publish junk either. \n \nWe decided we would find professionals in each of the spaces.  We would contract writers and outsource our blogging posts weekly. \n \nHINT: You can hire Sylviane to do this for you if you don’t have the time. \n \nEach week I would provide the bloggers with the keyword we were targeting for each post.  They would generate at least a 500 word post and send it back to us. \n \nWe would grab a creative commons image, plug it in, and publish it. \n \nGuess What? \n \nThis process worked, and once again we were driving sales and converting traffic. \n \nOur rankings increased and we were good again, at least for a while. \n \n  \n The Posts were Terrible  \nThe blog posts were driving traffic, but they were awful..  The blog posts lacked personality. \n \nThey were written by a hodgepodge of different bloggers.  The posts did nothing to foster a community. \n \nWe were producing blogs for zombies. \n \nThe process worked.  Zombies came through search engine traffic and purchased.  But it didn’t resonate with people. \n \nThey were blog posts without feeling. \n \nThey didn’t incorporate stories from real life situations. \n \n\n \nBut who cares, you may ask? \n \nYou should, and we do now. \n \nHere is why… \n \n  \n Let’s All Hug and Blog Together  \nSylviane has built an incredible blog over the years.   With this blog she has built an incredible community.  That’s you guys. \n \nThis isn’t luck. \n \nThis is perseverance and transparency. \n \nSylviane is real and tells us about herself. \n \nShe shares great posts like this one about low self esteem , or this one discussing tough times . \n \nThese posts help us get to know Sylviane and where she has come from.  I love these little stories that delve into people’s lives, and I don’t think I’m alone. \n \nStories draw in readers and show your personality.  They show your true feelings and let people understand your message. \n \nThis transparency is priceless and powerful. \n \n\n \nThis is a large reason that Bobby and I launched our blog .  We wanted to build a community.  If we could help people start their ecommerce businesses that was a plus. \n \n  \n My Big Regret  \nIn all the years that I have been making money online, I never built a community. \n \nI never wrote about myself or my online businesses. \n \nI was passionate about them, but didn’t want it to come off as bragging or knowing more than the next guy. \n \nI wasn’t comfortable sharing.  And to be 100% transparent, I’m still not comfortable with it. \n \nI don’t like self-promotion or chest pumping. \n \nIt’s not my style. \n \nI’d rather have a conversation with someone to learn about them, rather than talk about myself. \n \nA wise man once said: “You never learn anything by speaking” \n \nI have taken this advice to extremes. \n \nI always try and extract as much information as I can from people I meet. \n \nSo over the years, I spent my time listening and not speaking. \n \nBut speaking and promoting, unfortunately, is what helps you succeed.  So I started blogging on Long Live The Internet with two missions. \n  To help people learn from our successes and failures to build their own ecommerce site.  To push myself out of my comfort zone, and build a community of like-minded people interested in ecommerce.   \nSo like Sylviane, I try and get personal and tell people a funny story or something about me.  I try and incorporate a little something into each blog post. \n \n  \n Enough About Me… What’s Bad About Community Blogging  \nOk so that’s the answer right? \n \nThe magic answer is to be real and to blog transparently. \n \nJust publish nice content and your audience will grow. \n \nOver time they will naturally buy your products or services. \n \nNot So Fast… \n \nBlogging for a community is rewarding.  It brings clarity, and for me, helps relieve some stress.  But let’s not lose track of what this post is about. \n \nWe are trying to drive traffic to an ecommerce site.  We are trying to sell and make money. \n \nBlogging for a community can take years to grow and we are trying to pay the bills now with an ecommerce site. \n \nWe don’t have the luxury of building our community slowly. \n \nSo after many years and many experiments, I’m ready to tell you my secret recipe for blogging for ecommerce, and driving sales. \n \n  \n The Secret to Blogging for Ecommerce  \nThe secret is straightforward. \n \nYou can’t go all-in on either of these two approaches.  You have to find the blend of the two blogging styles that works for your audience.  Let’s look quickly at the pros and cons of the two approaches to blogging. \n Cold-hearted Keyword Blogging  \nPros \n \n– You can drive search engine traffic quickly \n \n– You don’t have to write the posts yourself \n \n– Small investments in an outsourced post often pay for themselves quickly \n \n– You free up your time \n \nCons \n \n– The traffic is frugal.  They are quick to leave and have no allegiance \n \n– It’s hit or miss and some posts do incredibly well while others flop \n \n– You aren’t building any allegiance to your brand or site \n \n– It feels impersonal and “icky” \n Transparent Community Blogging  \nPros \n \n– The traffic is recurring \n \n– People trust you and your proposition \n \n– You can make more than one sale and with a higher conversion rate \n \n– If you shift course your people will follow \n \nCons \n \n– This can take years to grow \n \n– You have to produce lots of good content over and over \n \n– You have to write most posts yourself \n \n– You have to be transparent (this can take some getting used to) \n \nNow you can see the differences clearly. \n \nSo what should you do? \n \n  \n Your Own Recipe  \nIf you are blogging for Ecommerce, you need targeted traffic. \n \nAdditionally, you need to build trust with your audience. \n \nYou can do this in a number of ways. \n \nFor example, my wife’s fashion jewelry site combines a little of both styles. \n \nShe personally interviews a featured jewelry designer each month.  This brings a personal angle to the blog and builds trust with readers. \n \nBetween these personal posts, she has blog posts that are purely informational.  These are less community oriented but attract search engine traffic. \n \nThis approach of combining personality posts, along with keyword rich posts, works. \n \nIt has helped her build an impressive online business with consistent traffic.  I may have helped some also. \n \nOver the years Bobby and I have started implementing this technique throughout our online businesses. \n \nOver time we saw increased traffic, higher return rates and increased conversions.  Despite the statistical improvements, we are feeling more transparent. \n \nIt’s important to make this combination work for you.  Each ecommerce site, and offering, is slightly different.  If you are the face of a brand, then you need to focus on being honest and transparent often. \n \nIf the ecommerce business is about the actual products, you can publish more search engine traffic posts. \n \nTie in personalization by mentioning how these products relate to you or others you know. \n \n  \n In Closing  \nPutting real people and real situations into your blog posts can help build trust and a community. \n \nYou can build an audience that comes back to buy from you. \n \nMore importantly, you are providing social proof and addressing a major buyer concern.  Remove obstacles to the sale, and you increase your bottom line. \n \nIn summary, you can’t afford to ignore keyword research and blogging for traffic.  But, once you get the zombies to your site, relate to them and show them your brand is real. \n \nThis equates to increased sales and customers who rally around your brand. \n \n  \n \nAgree? Disagree?  I would love to know what is or isn’t working for your ecommerce blogging in the comments below. \n \nThe post My Simple Blogging Secret from Selling Online for 10 Years appeared first on SylvianeNuccio.com .

43859f9c-178c-4df5-9bc7-af2aa5c3a57f	“You’re not going to die. Not in this room. Just bits of you.” (Photo: Yoga 105°)\nCome on, Max, just stay in the pose. And stop sweating quite so much.\nWe’ve been instructed to perform what’s known as Utkatasana, or the “Awkward Pose,” which aligns nicely with how I feel. It’s something of a beginner’s position, where you’re basically sitting into a squat with your hands raised above your head. It’s not the hardest contortion in Bikram Yoga, but anything is hard when the room’s been heated to 100-plus degrees.\nWe’re only midway through the 60-minute session, but I can no longer remember what the world outside this room looks like. Is heat always this oppressive? Does everyone wear sports bras? What time is it? How does one even measure time in this place?“You’re not going to die. Not in this room. Just bits of you.”\nAh, shit. I suddenly lose my focus, and, as a result, my balance, at which point I stumble off my mat. No one seems to notice—or rather, they are kind enough that they pretend not to. I take a moment to re-gain my composure before once again settling into the elusive Awkward Pose.\nEvery pose is my awkward pose. Why does it seem like my sweat is twice as shiny as that of the guy next to me?\nFinally, after another few seconds, our instructor gives us a moment to rest our bodies. The room of 20—roughly equal parts men and women—all instinctively roll onto their backs. I stare at the ceiling, trying to focus on breathing through my nose. On breathing at all.\nI’d always thought hot yoga was all Eastern-sounding music, kombucha tea, and oversexed 30-somethings. But this ... this is hard. I glare at the spindling cracks running through the linoleum, trying to clear my mind.\n“You’re not going to die. Not in this room,” Kara, the instructor, tells our class as she paces the rows of lifeless bodies. “Just bits of you.”It is yoga, appropriated for the Whole Foods crowd.\nBikram Choudhury, a former three-time National India Yoga Championship winner, launched the superheated program in San Francisco in 1972. Bikram Yoga consists of 26 postures, called asanas, which proponents say will stretch your muscles, oxidize your blood, and promote an elevated sense of overall well-being. (There’s actually plain old scientific research to support some of these claims.) Choudhury didn’t invent these postures; they’re basically just a selection of a much larger body of yoga poses, packaged together for simplicity and practicality. It is yoga, appropriated for the Whole Foods crowd. Bikram Yoga also requires that the room be heated to 104 degrees Fahrenheit—hence the epithet Hot Yoga, though that’s technically more of a catch-all phrase, which can be applied to any variation of yoga performed in extreme heat.Choudhury has made yoga, a 5,000-year-old tradition, into something that can be deftly monetized, like coconut-infused water, or a Lululemon sports bra.\nChoudhury himself is an odd duck, to say the least. He drives expensive cars, owns expensive homes, and, according to Clancy Martin’s superb piece in Details, acts as guru-on-demand for expensive people, like George Clooney and Lady Gaga—a role he’s not afraid to boast about. And his empire only continues to grow. As Martin writes:\nThese endorsements have helped him peddle Bikram-branded products, including books, CDs, DVDs, apparel, towels, mats, and water bottles. Besides charging for teacher training and studio licensing, he also generates revenue from fees for regional Bikram Yoga tournaments that produce a national champion each year. And he's looking for ways to expand his empire: He's in talks with several U.S. cable networks about a reality show, and Sun, an Indian company, wants to launch an all-Bikram channel. There are also plans for a satellite-radio show and a magazine. He's even campaigning to get yoga recognized as an Olympic sport.\nMartin’s story ran in 2011. Choudhury has yet to achieve all of these goals. (The idea of an Olympic bid in particular was met with some harsh criticism.) Still, that he should seek to monetize a meditation form so deeply rooted in the tradition of ego-banishment speaks to a dissonance between his capitalist values and the semi-mystical practice he purveys. It’s also illustrative of his polarizing ambition. He’s made yoga, a 5,000-year-old tradition, into something that can be deftly monetized, like coconut-infused water, or a Lululemon sports bra.\nAnd then there are the allegations.\nChoudhury has been accused of rape or sexual assault by six of his former students, and now faces a string of lawsuits. One suit mentions attempts at grabbing a woman’s crotch. Another woman claims that Choudhury raped her in his house while his wife and kids were upstairs. Many of these suits allude to Choudhury’s oversize influence not just in the Yoga sphere, but in the world at large. “He was too powerful to go against,” one suit reads. Choudhury, for his part, vehemently denies any wrongdoing. “Women like me. Women love me,” he told CNN earlier this year. “So if I really wanted to involve the women, I don't have to assault the women.”\nIn his Details story, Martin speaks to Choudhury about these allegations. The celebrity guru doesn’t deny them; he claims these accusers blackmailed him into sex. “Only when they give me no choice!” Choudhury hollers. “If they say to me, ‘Boss, you must fuck me or I will kill myself,’ then I do it! Think if I don’t! The karma!”\nHowever these allegations against its founder shake out, there’s no denying the sexual energy that seems to flow through Bikram Yoga. I notice this immediately in my own class. There’s a lot of sweat, and the silence, punctured only by heavy breathing, is almost erotic. This is a room, I think to myself the second we begin our first exercise, full of people who are very aware of their bodies.\nYoga 105° lies just off one of the main roads in Santa Barbara, California. It’s on the second floor of an especially airy shopping mall, along with a recovery center, a bridal store, and an Allstate. The interior Yoga room is dimly lit, with a big tree painted on the back wall, and a row of long mirrors in front. The studio used to be called Bikram Yoga Santa Barbara, but changed its name earlier this year, in an attempt to distance itself from Choudhury. The switch wasn’t merely a response to the allegations; as owner Mari Larangeira told the Santa Barbara Independent, there’d been long-running collective skepticism regarding the Bikram founder and his boisterous displays of wealth.\n“We’re all very grateful for what [Bikram] brought, but I think he’s kind of getting lost,” says Kara, my instructor. “There’s a difference between the asana, which is moving our bodies, and actually practicing Yoga, which is being mindful and thoughtful and caring.”\nKara seems like something of a poster-child for Bikram Yoga. Now 34 years old, she began practicing Bikram in 2005, when she was living in New York City, after finding a promotional flier for discounted classes. It was love at first pose. “The mind can get over-stimulated with all these different paths; everybody trying to become their best self. Through that we have all these expectations,” she tells me right after our class has concluded. (I am shirtless for this interview, which is a first.) “So people can get very depressed. And each asana takes a tremendous amount of focus. If you’re focusing on one thing, you’re not thinking about anything else. So people with depression, their minds go in a ton of different directions. Now, you’ve started to train your mind to focus on one spot.”\nI want to question the science behind these claims, but I don’t want to appear rude. And I have to admit, I feel great.\n“But,” I ask her, “how do you reconcile that with the fact that you’re teaching Bikram’s life’s work?” (Remember: The studio pays Choudhury a licensing fee, so, even with a name change, Yoga 105° is tied to the guy—in finances and reputation—in a very real sense.)\n“He just brought the yoga to the West,” Kara reasons. “It was already designed. He was a vehicle for that to come through. And oftentimes, you don’t keep your vehicles forever. You appreciate them, and you’re grateful for your experience with them. But you start to realize certain things don’t work, and you want to replace them with something new.”\nThis makes sense to me. Bikram Yoga is bigger than Bikram. It’s about calming your mind and improving mental health. Surrounded by scantily clad, well-sculpted middle-aged people, I seem to have the least agility, and the most chest hair, in the room. They are all perspiring together, all contorting their bodies in ways that would make Bikram grin with delight, with authority.\nBefore I leave, Kara encourages me to sign up for the 21-days-for-$35 package.\nThe mall seems airier, lonelier, when I leave Yoga 105°.

acedaa54-9820-4b71-aa7b-38dc7ed1d2a6	Dell Curry is many things "” the Charlotte Hornets"™ all-time leading scorer, the team"™s TV color analyst for the past six seasons and the father of NBA players Steph and Seth Curry. \n\nIn the past few months, Dell Curry has not only watched Steph win an NBA title with Golden State, but he has also become a grandfather again "” Steph and his wife, Ayesha, had another baby girl in July to join big sister Riley. And Dell Curry played a round of golf on Aug. 14 in a foursome that also included Steph, former NBA star Ray Allen and President Obama. \n\nCurry will return as a Hornets broadcaster again for his seventh season and said he is impressed that the Hornets have improved their perimeter shooting (which was always Curry"™s specialty in his playing days and is now the best part of his sons"™ games as well). I caught up with Curry this week by phone while he was in Utah on a hunting trip. \n\nQ: Is life any different for you now that Steph has won both an MVP and an NBA title? \n\nA: Well, a little. It"™s been a whirlwind summer, for sure. I"™m recognized  little more. \n\n \n \n\t \nAs my daughter said way back when Steph was at Davidson, he put me back on the map. After the Hornets"™ season ended, I was pretty much able to stay out in Oakland and go to all the playoff games and ride that wave with him and the family. \n\nQ: You will have two sons in the NBA this year, with Seth signing a two-year guaranteed deal to play for Sacramento. He had interest from several teams after starring in the D-league and the NBA"™s summer league, including Golden State. So why not go play beside his brother? \n\nA: I"™m really excited for Seth and proud of the way he has worked. He wants to create his own path in his own city, and I respect and understand that. Seth has an opportunity now. I know he can do it. He knows he can do it. But he still has to do it. \n\nQ: So how was playing golf with President Obama? \n\nA: That was one for the bucket list, for sure, to play golf with the most powerful man in the free world. Steph and I played against President Obama and Ray Allen. We lost on the 18th hole and lost a few bucks. The president is a good golfer. He plays from the left side and has a good short game. \n\nQ: You are a respected NBA analyst, and you are Steph"™s dad. If every NBA player was a free agent, you were a head coach and you got the No. 1 pick to start a new team, would you choose LeBron, Steph or someone else? \n\nA: Wow, that"™s a loaded one. All things considered, I"™m going Curry. \n\n"”"”"” \n\nÂ©2015 The Charlotte Observer (Charlotte, N.C.) \n\nVisit The Charlotte Observer (Charlotte, N.C.) at www.charlotteobserver.com \n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \n\n_____ \n\nTopics: c000213164
fa128c30-94fe-43a9-a269-b646d0cbb83e	tTwo Saturdays ago I got a call from my wife while I was teaching. She said that somebody had driven into our fence with their car and then drove away. It was during one of hose heavy downpours of rain we had. Her mother (my mother-in-law) heard it. It was a terrible noise. She looked out the window and saw the car. It was white. But that was all she could see. My wife called the police and made a report. When I came home that night I saw that we were very lucky. Our car was parked in the driveway right next to the fence. But, only the fence was damaged. We wondered what we could do. Later, my wife told me that we had insurance. It covers natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires and floods. It also covers accidents such as this one. Lucky us! We called them and they said to send pictures and a copy of the police report and they will pay. We were very relieved. We thought we might have to pay. And everything was fine until the culprit (the person who did the bad deed) showed up (appeared) at our  door day three days later. To be continued.
9d486048-bcc2-488c-be8a-32d7913c3b3b	You can learn a lot by eavesdropping on the train. I’ve stumbled onto ideas for columns, broadened my understanding of diversity, economics and myriad other topics, not to mention made new friends. \n \nRecently, a couple of those new friends — a husband and wife counseling team — were discussing the husband’s plan for an upcoming men’s church retreat. He was complaining mildly that participants’ desire to relax wasn’t right. He felt they should do something more useful with the time by planning an enrichment event for young men in the church, for example. But if rest and relaxation were paramount, they should at least choose a black-owned venue. \n \nHe’d even found one — one that his cohorts weren’t pleased with because the price for the bed and breakfast was $50 more per night than the next comparable option that was not black-owned. \n \nWhy is that so important, I asked? I knew the likely answer, but my news nose was tingling. \n \nHe went on to talk about the need for economic parity and promoting economic growth among black people, which he felt is just as if not even more important than building up a church community. He and his wife peppered our discussion with historical references: The black community was stronger in the 1920s and ’30s when it was segregated and we were forced to rely on black businesses to survive; in the 1960s and ’70s, black people had vision. They understood the bigger picture and why it was critical to “buy black” lest those valuable dollars continue to flee our community, leaving behind substandard goods and services at markedly higher prices. \n \nThat’s all well and good, but there’s a reason why I don’t buy black. I’m willing to pay a higher price to support the community, but what I don’t support, I told my new train friend, is bad service, shoddy retail space and poor product selections. \n \nTo defend my decisions, I described a vivid and repetitive scene featuring apathetic store clerks and me, walking in ready to plunk down my hard-earned dollars for whatever was suitable, and being stared at as if to say, “Why are you here?” My new acquaintance agreed, but then he began to talk about awareness. \n \nThose clerks, he said, were operating from a deficit. They did not know how to behave toward customers. “The clerk doesn’t know he or she should speak to me and look engaged when I come into the store?” I asked skeptically. That’s Business Operations 101. \n \nHe nodded solemnly. Those clerks and the business owners who employ them likely have not been groomed to engage customers correctly. The breakdown, he said, between vision and community created a vast knowledge gap that is slowly but surely crippling black business. \n \nI considered this in light of what I know about the power of mentorship and sponsorship, the need to reach back and pull forward those who may not have had the same start, but still need to compete on the same field. Then I considered my new friend’s words in light of what I’ve learned about supplier diversity. This year, we made the decision to feature at least one story on the topic in every issue. If my new train friend’s conversation was any indication, we were more on target than I realized. \n \nBlack communities are woefully short on black-owned businesses. This relates to the economic health and growth of our particular demographic. If consumers like me don’t buy black because of bad service, and bad service is related to lack of awareness, knowledge and skills, it’s more important than ever that corporate supplier diversity programs offer minority business owners the training they may need to compete effectively, expand their businesses and contribute to the economic health of the community. \n \nCheck out our feature “In Short Supply” to learn more about what companies like Kroger and Walgreens are doing to ensure their supplier diversity programs work. And be sure to let me know what practices you’ve observed at work or believe should be a part of supplier diversity programs. It’s worth examining closely. Companies, communities and families may depend on it.
0074179e-cac1-409c-8dbc-598877434181	Back in the day, Jeff Renz helped pour cement for the M on Mount Sentinel. \n\nMore recently, the law professor had students argue before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \n\nRenz, a longtime professor at the Alexander Blewett III School of Law at the University of Montana, came to Missoula in 1967. He studied forestry, got a degree in botany, and eventually received a law degree from UM. \n\nAfter 14 years in private practice, including several working on high-profile environmental cases for a firm based in Chicago, Renz returned to the law school at UM to teach. He's been on an annual contract since 1993. \n\nAt the end of this semester, the teacher and director of the criminal defense clinic will retire. His departure is linked to the budget crunch at UM, and he appears to be the only contracted professor whose annual employment isn't being renewed because of money. \n\nIn a letter to colleagues this summer, Renz announced his departure. \n\n"The university's notice comes as a great disappointment to me for many reasons," Renz wrote. "Many of you were my former students. Many of my former students became prosecutors and now sit as judges. \n\n"I have always found joy in my students' growth from unsure to confident, from arrogant to humble (most of the time), and from ignorance to enlightenment. I will miss that." \n\n*** \n\nThe cut at the law school comes despite the fact it is on solid financial footing and steady enrollment, Renz said. \n\n"The law school has never had budget issues. We've always sent money to Main Hall, and still have been doing that," he said. \n\nEnrollment at the law school also has not dropped, he said. In fact, he said, as other law schools across the country saw significant drops in the quality of applicants, such as lower GPA and LSAT scores, the rankings ticked up at UM. \n\nHe said the law school in Missoula was recently one of just four that counted an increase in the number of applicants. \n\nBut the overall enrollment numbers at UM have been in decline. \n\n"So when that happens, the university calls back money from units," Renz said. "And we'd been doing our fair share from year to year, and this past year, the provost called back a little bit more, and it was a little bit more than the school could bear without making cuts in the program." \n\nIn his letter to colleagues, he offered a stark description of the effects of the four-year dip: "The university cut fat, then more fat, then meat, and now we are down to the bone. I am not the first full-time faculty member to be rif'd (reduction in force), but I am the first full-time member of the law faculty upon whom the ax has fallen." \n\n*** \n\nDean Paul Kirgis, who came on board this summer, agreed the law school was doing well financially. \n\nHe said it continues to receive a steady stream of applications in contrast to the roughly 45 percent drop in law school applicants around the country. \n\nHowever, Kirgis said the overall financial picture at UM affects the law school. He said he wasn't part of the negotiation with Renz, but said the agreement came about because of the university-wide need for budget restraint. \n\n"We are not facing an ongoing budget crisis in the law school, and we have no expectation that we will ... going forward," Kirgis said. \n\nHe said the law school did not make other personnel cuts as a result of the budget crunch. \n\n*** \n\nLast semester, the school received a $10 million naming gift from the Blewett family of Great Falls. However, Renz said in his letter the money that could fund his position wouldn't be available for several years. \n\n"It's sort of ironic, but it's understandable," Renz said. \n\nHe also said that his position as a contracted professor made him vulnerable, although he himself had recommended his job be designed that way years ago. \n\n"In terms of budget, I was always low-hanging fruit," Renz said. \n\nHis end date will be Feb. 29. He said the school didn't give him adequate notice of one semester, so he and the former interim dean worked out a deal. \n \nThe agreement gives Renz the upcoming semester to work on his own research, which he will do in Berkeley, California, where his wife will be for a Fulbright award. In exchange, he said, UM avoids paying some three or four months of salary. \n\n"It was a good compromise," Renz said. \n\nHe had planned to retire after this school year or next, regardless: "So it was not an emotional hit for me." \n\n*** \n\nElaine Gagliardi, associate dean of students and professor at the law school, has worked with Renz for roughly 20 years. \n\n"I have great respect for professor Renz, and I've seen him add a lot to our program," Gagliardi said. "And he has always had very interesting clinic projects that I know have made a difference in a lot of people's lives." \n\nAs part of the criminal defense clinic, "a live client program," Renz guided students as they represented their first defendants. The law school clinic offers the future lawyers real-world experience. \n\n"This is your client. You will learn to swim," Renz said of his approach. "I will be there helping you. Last year, I had students try four cases to a verdict, and they won three of them." \n\nEvery year, his students argue in the Ninth Circuit, "and they do great. It's phenomenal for the experience. Just for having done it." \n\nIn fact, he said, the students are the highlight of the years he spent at the law school. It was satisfying to see them grow and excel, he said, and rewarding to see them become seasoned professionals. \n\nThe parting was sometimes painful, though. \n\n"About every three years, I get a class where I literally grieve when they graduate," Renz said. \n\nThe professor has had other career successes beyond campus. A couple years ago, he was the recipient of a Fulbright, which took him to the country of Georgia. \n\nHe also worked with former School of Journalism professor Clem Work on seeking posthumous pardons for people convicted of sedition. Gov. Brian Schweitzer signed the proclamation of pardons in Helena in 2006, with many families of those convicted in attendance. \n\n"That was very satisfying. We persuaded the governor to pardon all these people from World War I," Renz said.
ddf3dfd2-cc21-46ca-a0e7-bd66eeb6bec6	An estranged father tracked down his seven-year-old daughter and shot her in the head on her doorstep before turning the gun on himself, an inquest has heard. \n \nEast Sussex coroner Alan Craze described the murder outside a "safe house" as a "thoroughly despicable act of violence" and said: "It was not in any way spontaneous. It was pre-meditated over a long period of time." \n \nMary Shipstone, also known as Maryam Alromisse, was gunned down as she stood next to her mother, clutching a new violin, after she returned from school on September 11 last year, Hastings Coroner's Court was told. \n \nHer father, Yasser Alromisse, 46, was hidden in the rear of a silver Toyota on the drive by the house, in Northiam, near Rye, East Sussex, when he fired the shots. \n \nThe attack took place at Spring Hill, where Mary had lived with her mother Lyndsey Shipstone, for the past year.  She did not want be traced by Alromisse after the collapse of their marriage, which she said had been abusive. \n \nAlromisse had hired the vehicle that morning in Worthing, insisting to rental staff that he needed one with tinted windows, and had created a blind from bin bags to shield himself, the hearing was told. \n \nHis body was later found in a pool of blood in the rear of the car, where he had shot himself in the head. \n \nMr Craze concluded that Mary had been unlawfully killed, and ruled her father's death as suicide. \n \nThe court heard how Alromisse had hired private detective Paul Parton, purporting to be a friend of his ex-wife, in May 2014 to try and establish the location of Mrs Shipstone, who he was still legally married to. \n \nMr Parton was unable to locate Mrs Shipstone and later withdrew his services concerned Alromisse's motive was to take away the child. \n   Promoted stories   \nCoroner Mr Craze said it was not clear how Alromisse eventually found the address, but described the murder as a "thoroughly despicable act of violence". \n \nHe added: "It was not in any way spontaneous. It was pre-meditated over a long period of time." \n \nDescribing the day of the shooting, Mrs Shipstone said it had been "ordinary", but that Mary was "very happy" and "excited" about her birthday in seven days' time. \n \nShe had been driven by a neighbour to collect Mary from school where she had had her first violin lesson. They parked up at their neighbour's and walked back towards their house. \n \nMrs Shipstone told the court: "I was putting my key in the door, and I spoke to Mary, saying she'd like what I had done to her room, and that's the last thing I said to her." \n \nMary was stood slightly behind her when she heard a loud noise. \n \nShe said: "There was a terrific sound behind me like someone had burst a balloon. \n \n"I turned around and the first thing I saw was Mary on the ground - her legs were crumpled behind her." \n \nShe said she quickly realised that her ex-partner had shot Mary, saying she could "see his face" in the back seat of the Toyota parked on the nearby drive. \n \nShe told the inquest: "He did not show any emotion." \n \nMrs Shipstone carried Mary to a neighbour's home, where they tried to revive her while waiting for emergency services to arrive.  She was taken to King's College Hospital, London, but later died of her injuries. \n \nAsked why Alromisse would have wanted to kill Mary, Mrs Shipstone replied: "I don't think I will ever really know that. \n \n"It was such an extreme thing to do. I can only guess that he wanted to kill himself and for some reason he thought that she should not live without him." \n \nShe added: "He had the opportunity to shoot me as well, but he chose not to do it, and I was the one he supposedly hated the most. \n \n"It's an act of revenge really. It's got to be. If he really loved her he would never have inflicted that on her." \n \nMrs Shipstone told the court: "He's left me bereft of a daughter". \n \nMr Craze described it as a "very sad and tragic case". \n \nSpeaking to Mrs Shipstone after reaching his conclusion, he said: "You will, I hope, be relieved that the whole process of the coroner's inquest is over with. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n"You have got through it and I hope that the process will be deemed useful to you. \n \n"But the main thing is you can put a full stop at the end of this chapter and get on with your life."
2dea8451-cbcd-42b9-a263-ffc3397bde43	The veteran captain of a London-bound British Airways plane has been hailed a "hero" for his response to an engine fire at a Las Vegas airport. \n \nInvestigations continue into what caused the left engine of the Boeing 777-200 to burst into flames on the runway at McCarran International Airport, forcing 157 passengers, 10 crew and three pilots to evacuate through emergency slides. \n \nThe captain was named as Chris Henkey, from Reading, Berkshire, who has four decades of flying experience with BA and is about to retire. \n \nHis fiancee, Lenka Nevolna, 40, said: "He's a hero. He's a great man with a warm heart, and generosity, and I'm very proud of him." \n \nShe said she was "very shocked" by what had happened and added: "I'm glad that no one's hurt and everything is going to be fine." \n \nAsked if he is always so cool and calm, she said: "Yes, most of the time, and he's loved by everyone, we are very proud of him." \n \nShe did not have to worry if he had been involved in the incident, because he rang her to tell her about it, then she watched the news. \n \nShe confirmed he is about to retire, adding: "Unfortunately what happened, we couldn't have predicted." \n \nHis ex-wife Marnie, who is a former cabin crew member and with whom he has a daughter, expressed her relief that he and the rest of the crew got out safely. \n \n"He is safe and happy," she told the Guardian. "I've had some messages from him. He did a bloody good job." \n \nFire officials said at least 14 people were taken to hospital with minor injuries, mostly caused by sliding down the inflatable chutes to escape. \n \nThe airport released a statement which said it was first alerted to the emergency at 4.13pm local time (12.13am BST) and within five minutes everyone was off the plane and the blaze was extinguished. \n   Promoted stories   \nAn audio recording which appears to be the conversation between the captain and air traffic control shows how efficiently the emergency was dealt with. \n \nSpeaking calmly and clearly, th e pilot said: "Mayday, mayday, Speedbird 2276 request fire services." \n \nThe woman in the control tower immediately replied: "Heavy fire services on the way." \n \nForty seconds later the captain added: "We are evacuating on the runway. We have a fire. I repeat, we are evacuating." \n \nAccording to reports the captain was applauded by passengers when he spoke to them in the safety of the terminal building. \n \nBA would not confirm the identity of the captain but said he was " very experienced and has flown with British Airways for 42 years". \n \nA spokeswoman for the airport said the passengers were evacuated "quickly and safely". \n \nShe went on: " We cannot express enough gratitude to the emergency response crews, as well as the British Airways crew." \n \nThe BA flight from Las Vegas was set to depart for the 10-hour flight to Gatwick when the crew noticed the fire. \n \nBA issued a statement which said the plane "experienced a technical issue" and the crew "evacuated the aircraft safely". \n \nThe airline added it had provided hotel accommodation and was organising alternative flights for its 157 customers, while those who had been taken to hospital had since been discharged.. \n \nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US  said four investigators had been sent to examine the aircraft, including engine, systems and fire specialists. \n \nBA would not reveal how many Britons were on the plane, although the  Las Vegas to Gatwick route is popular with UK leisure travellers. \n \nJacob Steinberg, a Guardian sports reporter who was on the flight, said the captain told passengers there had been a "catastrophic" engine failure. \n \nHe tweeted: " Was asleep as the plane took off. Came to a crashing halt. Smell of smoke. Initially told to stay seated, then shout of evacuate. \n \n"Could smell and see smoke but was on other side of plane. One person said fire melted a couple of windows. \n \n"They opened the back door and slide went down and smoke started coming in plane, followed by mad dash to front. A lot of panic." \n   \n Share article  \n   \nBoeing said in a statement that it was "prepared to provide technical assistance to the NTSB following today's incident". \n \nMcCarran is a major airport in the US, handling almost 43 million passengers a year.
eacc9625-b22d-4a44-a62e-7d53c132af1a	"It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction," Trump said Monday at a press conference at Trump Tower in New York as he unveiled his plan to revamp the tax code. "It'll simplify the tax code, it'll grow the American economy at a level that it hasn't seen for decades."\n\nThe highly anticipated tax plan comes as Trump is being pressed to provide more details about how his administration would govern.\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries appears to be families that draw the smallest paychecks. Individuals that make less than $25,000 (and $50,000 for married couples) would pay no income taxes under Trump's plan.\n\nHowever, the proposal would also be a boon for the wealthiest Americans like Trump -- the top bracket includes individuals making $150,001 and more and couples making $300,001 and more -- who would pay an income tax rate of 25%. That's a dramatic cut from the current top rate of close to 40%.\n\nThe tax cuts for top earners could open Trump up to charges of hypocrisy. The real estate magnate has surged to the top of the polls by touting a populist tone, lamenting that wealthy people like himself should pay more.\n\nAsked at Monday's press conference how his proposal would affect his own tax rate, Trump dodged the question, saying: "We're reducing taxes, but believe me, there will be people in the very upper echelon that won't be thrilled with this."\n\nHe also declined to say how much taxes he currently pays, only saying, "I fight like hell to pay as little as possible."\n\nPerhaps the most pressing question that Trump must answer is how he would raise enough revenue to offset his plan's deep tax cuts, though he insisted Monday that his proposal would not add to the country's debt or deficit.\n\nThe candidate says he would make up for the difference in a number of ways: killing certain deductions for the rich and creating incentives for U.S. companies to bring back cash currently held overseas, thereby boosting growth at home.\n\nTrump's tax plan broadly mirrors that of one of his main rivals: Jeb Bush.\n\nBush's proposal released this month also reduces the number of income tax brackets -- to three from the current seven. The highest tax bracket under the former Florida governor's plan is 28%, and the lowest is 10%. Bush also proposed lowering the corporate tax rate from 25% to 20% -- another popular idea among conservatives. Trump would go even further, lowering the rate to 15%.\n\nLike Bush, one loophole Trump would target is the preferential treatment for carried interest, which is a share of profits paid to investment managers.\n\nSince launching his White House campaign in June, Trump has made sweeping attacks on hedge fund managers who are paid in carried interest.\n\nTrump, who claims that his personal assets are valued at more than $10 billion, frequently makes the distinction between investors who work in real estate and those on Wall Street. Hedge fund managers, he often says, fall in the category of special interests backing some of his well-connected and best-funded rivals.\n\n"I know them. They all are supporting Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton," Trump told CNN at a campaign stop in Nashville, Tennessee, last month. "They make a lot of money and a lot of it is luck. They pick a stock and all of a sudden they make a lot of money. I want the hedge fund guys to pay more taxes."\n\nStill, the plan might not be too tough on Wall Street. Since Trump's proposal would slash the income tax rate across the board, taxing carried interest as regular income under Trump's plan would mean investors still pay far less than what they would if the carried interest loophole were done away with under the current tax code.\n\nThe tax rate of hedge fund managers is a favorite political target for the 2016 presidential candidates.\n\n"We will treat all noninvestment income the same, so unless you stake capital in an investment, you won't be able to claim the capital-gains tax rate on your market gains," Bush's tax proposal said.\n\nIt's also popular rallying cry for the Democratic candidates.\n\nFormer Secretary of Hillary Clinton has been hitting Wall Street tax breaks since the first days of her campaign, as she's faced pressure from progressive Democrats to embrace a more populist agenda. Antagonism towards Wall Street is a central message of Clinton's rivals like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.
e2fac553-db94-482f-bd60-1889853028da	By KUNDUZ CITY, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Taliban fighters battled their way into the centre of Kunduz city in northern Afghanistan on Monday and seized the provincial governor's office, in one of the most serious security breaches in 14 years of war, witnesses and officials said.\n\nThe insurgents raised the white Taliban banner over the central city square and freed hundreds of fellow militants from the local jail, in a major embarrassment for Afghan forces who abandoned a provincial headquarters for the first time.\n\nThe stunning assault came a day before President Ashraf Ghani's unity government marked its first anniversary.\n\nIt was the second time this year that the hardline Islamist movement has besieged Kunduz city, defended by Afghan forces battling largely without NATO's support after it withdrew most of its troops last year. \n\nThe insurgents launched a surprise, three-pronged offensive before dawn, and by evening they had captured the governor's compound and provincial police headquarters, said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesman for the hardline Islamist movement.\n\n"Our fighters are now advancing towards the airport," Mujahid said on his Twitter account.\n\nA senior government official in Kabul confirmed that the provincial headquarters had fallen and Afghan forces were regrouping at the airport.\n\nDozens of Afghan special forces have been flown into Kunduz airport on a C-130 aircraft and were preparing to launch a counter-attack, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n"IT LOOKS GRIM"\n\nThe Kunduz assault marks a troubling development in the insurgency, although Afghan forces have managed to drive the Taliban back from most of the territory they have gained this year during an escalation in violence.\n\n"It is certainly the first major breach of a provincial capital since 2001," said Graeme Smith, senior analyst for International Crisis Group.\n\n"They are choking the Afghan forces from all sides. It looks pretty grim."\n\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan evacuated its Kunduz compound on Monday morning, soon after the assault began.\n\n"They've been relocated within Afghanistan," said U.N. spokesman Dominic Medley, declining to say where or how many staff were evacuated.\n\nAbdullah Danishy, deputy governor of Kunduz, vowed that Afghan forces would retake the occupied city.\n\n"We have reinforcements coming from other areas and will beat back the Taliban," Danishy said by telephone from Kunduz airport after fleeing his office.\n\nBut with much of downtown Kunduz now in Taliban hands and terrified civilians either trying to flee or hiding inside their homes, the insurgents may be tough to dislodge.\n\n"Once they get inside an urban area, your air assets and artillery become much less useful," Smith said.\n\nFAMILIES SEPARATED\n\nThe Taliban were ousted in 2001 after a U.S.-led campaign, and have been fighting to reimpose their rule in sporadic clashes ever since. They have stepped up their offensive this year as NATO forces drew down to just a few thousand troops.\n\nOne Reuters witness saw buildings on fire in the south of the city and Taliban fighters entering a 200-bed government-run hospital.\n\nDozens of panicked residents fled to the city's main airport but were turned away by security forces. \n\nElectricity and phone services were cut across most of the city, and family members struggled to locate one another in the chaos.\n\n"My uncle's wife has been killed by the Taliban today and still my wife and kids are in the area that the Taliban captured, so it is important to free my family," said Matin Safraz, an official at the interior ministry who was visiting Kunduz for the Muslim holiday of Eid.\n\nSafraz had retreated to the airport, and said he was prepared to fight the Taliban with a borrowed AK-47 rifle.\n\nSayed Sarwar Hussaini, a spokesman for Kunduz police, said \n\n20 Taliban fighters had been killed and three Afghan police wounded in the early morning clashes.

d8ec5d11-bf4d-4464-8dc7-c0984563181b	FOX LAKE, Ill. — Authorities broadened the hunt Wednesday for three suspects wanted in the fatal shooting of a popular Illinois police officer, even as they acknowledged that they had no indication the men were still in the area where the slaying happened. \n \nAfter an intensive 14-hour “grid search” of homes, railroad tracks and marshland in the village of Fox Lake, the second-day manhunt turned to the painstaking detective work of chasing down tips, collecting and reviewing surveillance video and interviewing residents near the crime scene. Meanwhile, new search teams rippled out into subdivisions beyond the initial 2-square-mile perimeter established on Tuesday. At least 100 investigators were on the ground. \n \nA major challenge was the lack of a description of the suspects beyond the vague one that came from the officer, who told dispatchers he was pursuing three suspicious men — two white, one black — moments before he was shot. \n \n“That was the only description provided,” said Lake County Major Crimes Task Force Cmdr. George Filenko, the lead investigator on the case. “So of course we’re getting the public calling in every time they see that match of three individuals or even two individuals. We’ve closed out those leads completely as being unsubstantiated.” \n \nLt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz, a 30-year police veteran, was shot Tuesday morning while pursuing the men he spotted on his way to work, Filenko said. Gliniewicz told dispatchers the three ran into a swampy area, and he requested a second unit. \n \nDispatchers soon lost contact with him. Backup officers found him about 50 yards from his squad car with a gunshot wound. He died soon after. \n \nFilenko said there was no indication he was intentionally targeted, though authorities did not rule out that possibility. \n \nThe initial, frenzied search for his killers involved law enforcement agencies from across the state. Some wore tactical gear and toted high-powered rifles. Officers took up positions on rooftops and along railroad tracks and scanned the terrain through rifle scopes and binoculars. Others leaned out of helicopters with weapons at the ready. \n \nOn Tuesday night, they declared the initial search zone clear, allowing investigators to begin poring over the crime scene and surrounding area. \n \nStill, they knocked on doors with caution. \n \n“I believe that the search teams did a thorough job, but I know there have been a number of national incidents where suspects have cleverly escaped or hidden in place,” Filenko said. “So anything’s possible.” \n \nInvestigators were reviewing video recordings, but so far none has captured images of the suspects, Filenko said. \n \nDespite the challenges, he told reporters that he felt the teams were making progress. \n \n“As always, we’re relying on the public, too,” he said. “All it takes is one tip or good lead to break a case wide open.” \n \nResidents of the usually sleepy community were urged to stay vigilant. Schools that went on lockdown the day of the shooting were closed a day later. \n \nAn emotional Mayor Donny Schmit described the slain officer as a personal friend and a father of four sons. \n \n“We lost a family member,” Schmit said of the 52-year-old officer known around town as “G.I. Joe.” ”His commitment to the people of this community has been unmatched and will be dearly missed.” \n \nWorkers adorned the village hall with black and purple bunting in a display of mourning. Several evening vigils were planned. \n \nEleven-year-old Takoa Thomas, a sixth grader, stood on the side of a road with a handmade sign that read “Cops’ lives matter. RIP GI Joe.” \n \n“I wanted to be out here to show support,” the boy said. \n \nHis mother, Tara England, 41, said the boy’s school was closed, and she had mixed feelings about their safety. \n \n“One of the reasons I’m out here is I don’t want to be home alone,” she said. “My husband’s at work.” \n \n“But if it were me, I’d be long gone,” she said of the suspects. \n \nThe area near the Wisconsin border area is popular for boating and other outdoor pursuits because of its forest preserves and a chain of lakes that partly encircles Fox Lake. \n \nGliniewicz’s death is the third law enforcement fatality in Illinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which tracks officers’ deaths so their names can be enshrined on a Washington, D.C., memorial. \n \nIt says police shooting deaths in the U.S. are down 13 percent this year compared with the same January-to-September period last year. There were 30 last year and 26 this year. \n \nAttorney General Loretta Lynch condemned the recent fatal shootings, telling a housing conference in Washington that violence against “all of us, regardless of what uniform any of us wear” must end. \n \nLynch said it’s a “sad fact now” that no one is safe, citing shootings of churchgoers at a Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina, moviegoers in Louisiana, military personnel in Tennessee and two television journalists killed on the air last week in Virginia. \n  In Other News
37cb369b-c6b4-42ba-939a-d77e5341686e	Nearly 7,000 people have called on BrewDog – a British craft beer company – to remove an advert many have labelled transphobic. Thousands of customers have promised to boycott BrewDog unless the offending video is removed. The video – called Don’t Make Us Do This – asks fans of the company to become “investors”. In order to “avoid embarrassment”, co-founders James Watt and Martin Dickie then beg viewers not force them into damaging or humiliating experiences. A few examples of said experiences are then given – such as begging for money on the streets or becoming a trans sex worker. Watt and Dickie are then shown standing in a brothel window in women’s underwear and a wig. Watt and Dickie then say they “need a bath”. A petition to remove the advert has been issued, stating: “BrewDog beer company claims to be ‘beer for punks’. They claim to be ethical. “Yet in their new crowdsourcing video they mock homeless people, trans women and sex workers.” “They say, ‘don’t make us do this’ – whilst performing as offensive caricatures of people, many of whom already suffer discrimination every day,” the petition adds. “They are mocking the lives and experiences of people who real punks would be defending and helping.” “Worse, this is a fundraising video – they’re using these images in an exploitative manner to make money.” One of the petitioners – Sarah Burns – said, “Not cool, BrewDog. Not punk, not funny, not ethical, and not cool. “My husband and I are big fans of your beer but we’ll both be boycotting it until this ad is pulled. “‘Don’t make us do this'” my f***ing arse. Remember, the rule is punch up, not down.” Last week, it was reported that hundreds of “transphobic” students walked out of school, after refusing to share a changing room with a fellow pupil because she was trans.

4534295d-c5f0-47d1-91d9-dcd65f45bf6a	A man involved in a road rage incident will await a psychiatric report before sentencing in December. \n             \nA man will stay in custody at Hillmorton Hospital awaiting sentence after admitting running down a man in a road rage incident. \n \nDuring the remand, a psychiatric report will be prepared on how to deal with 51-year-old Andrew George McDaniel at his sentencing on December 15. \n \nThe report was ordered along with a report on McDaniel's suitability for home detention when he pleaded guilty to five charges in the Christchurch District Court on Tuesday. \n \nThe Swannanoa property developer was charged with injuring a man with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and wilfully illtreating a dog by injuring it causing it pain to the extent that it was necessary to destroy the animal to end its suffering. He aced separate charges of assault, driving with excess breath-alcohol and careless driving. \n \nThe most serious charges arose from an incident that took place on March 23, at the Eyre River crossing in Downs Rd, near Rangiora. \n \nMcDaniel was driving a dark-grey four-wheel-drive Nissan. \n \nA man out walking the family's 10-month-old puppy, with his wife and two children at about 5.45pm, signalled to McDaniel to slow down when he drove out of the river crossing. \n \nMcDaniel then manoeuvred the car with a series of u-turns to try to knock the man down. \n \nThe man tried to avoid the vehicle by jumping over a fence but was struck and then the puppy was hit by the car as it drove away from the scene. \n \nThe man received treatment for cuts to his hands from the fence, cuts and bruises on his head and injuries to his shoulder and ankle. The puppy was put down.  \n    \n 
c4a1f668-b653-45d9-a95a-bb692c3e81cb	Britons unfairly charged IHT between 2011 and 2014 Specialist firm says thousands are due compensation But it claims making a case is 'fiendishly complicated' without help  \nUp to 30,000 Britons with holiday homes in Spain could still be due compensation from its government after they were hit with 'unfair' inheritance tax charges. \n\nThe punitive tax charge was made between 2011 and 2014 on non-residents – which in Spanish law is those who live there for less than half the year – who inherited a home. This included husbands and wives whose spouses died.  \n\nThe redress is expected to run into millions of euros for those hit. According to estimates by specialist solicitors Spanish Legal Reclaims after analysing government data, around 30,000 paid tax in the three-year period. \n   \nUnfair tax: Those who faced an IHT bill on their Spanish holiday home during 2011-14 are entitled to compensation. Pictured, Andalucia in southern Spain \n\nThe tax charge was in many cases up to a third of the property's value and it varied between regions. \n\nIt can only be reclaimed by EU citizens after the Spanish government hastily changed its IHT law after the European Court of Justice ruled the legislation - which exempted residents from the charge - was discriminatory. \n\nThe ruling was made last September but it is believed thousands still haven't got the ball rolling with compensation - despite there being a five year limit to put a claim in.  \n \nClaims typically take between six to eight months to process once they've been filed and the first glut of compensation is now being paid out. \n\nUnder the law, between 2011 and 2014 Spanish residents were exempt from up to 99 per cent of the tax charge depending on region, while homeowners with a property there had to pay the full amount within six months of inheriting. \n\nWith more Britons owning holiday homes in the sun in Spain than any other nationality, UK citizens were disproportionately affected. \n\nThey include Joan Ridsdale, a 62-year-old payroll administrator from County Durham who was hit with a €16,000 tax bill when her husband Gordon died. The couple owned a two-bedroom bungalow in the coastal resort of Almeria. \n\nMrs Ridsdale was forced to cash in her life savings to pay the charge and has since sold the property. \n\nThe Spanish authorities are now being forced to repay the inheritance tax paid by non-residents like Mrs Ridsdale. \n\nShe was one of the first to receive compensation from the Government earlier in the year. \n\nThe average repayment is €25,000, according to Spanish Legal Reclaims, a Barcelona-based law firm which specialises in helping non-residents to reclaim overpaid tax. \n   \nEU ruling: Last year, EU said the Spanish Government had acted unfairly - and people can claim redress \n\nLuis Cuervo, chief executive of Spanish Legal Reclaims, said: 'Losing a loved one is hard enough, but to then receive an unfair tax bill rubs salt in the wound. Yet for years this is what happened to thousands of Britons inheriting holiday homes in Spain. \n\n'Spain's authorities have agreed that non-residents who inherited a Spanish property during the past four-and-a-half years can claim back the tax they paid – but doing so is a complex and daunting task, as there is no single form to fill in. \n\n'Inheritors can only claim once, so it's essential they seek expert legal advice to ensure they get it right first time. \n\n'Spanish Legal Reclaims is representing 1,000 families from across the EU who find themselves in this position, and since the ECJ's landmark ruling our firm has had a 100 per cent success rate, securing a full refund of tax in every case.' \n\nBritons account for a substantial part of the law firm's business, it says.  \n\nThe largest refund it secured for a British client was €94,000, the smallest €4,400. \n\nHowever, it takes a large 35 per cent chunk of any compensation on a 'no win, no fee' basis. \n\nMrs Ridsdale used the firm to handle her case – it secured a full refund of her €16,000 tax bill, plus €700 in back interest from the Spanish taxman.  \n\nBut, with the fees, she was left with just under €11,000. \n\nThe firm says it is possible for British holiday homeowners to reclaim the tax themselves, but it is 'fiendishly difficult'. \n\nThey need to work out whether they can claim and then the process involves filling in multiple forms and making your case in court, which is all in Spanish.  \n\nHomeowners only get one attempt to lodge a compensation bid. \n\n 
08679f4f-0b8b-452b-8cca-4cb538993417	NASHVILLE, TN (WSMV) - \n\nPolice said they have noticed a reemerging trend where criminals intentionally run into the back of a victim’s car.\n\nSgt. Rafael Fernandez with Metro police spoke to the church at Woodbine’s Joy Club on Tuesday about the topic.\n\n“I’d like to talk to everybody about the bump and rob,” Fernandez said. “Has everybody heard of the bump and rob?”\n\nPolice said the bump and rob is when criminals purposely run into the back of a victim’s car. When it’s time to exchange information, the thieves then rob them and often take their car.\n\n“Another situation is where they pull out in front of you really quickly, hit the brakes and then you hit them,” Fernandez said.\n\nPolice don’t want to alarm people. At the South Precinct, they have had two or three victims of the technique, but not enough to send out an email warning the public.\n\n“You’re already upset and you’re already like … I hope they have insurance,” said Akeylah Robinson, a victim of bump and rob. “But then you have to worry about is this person going to rob my car? Which is really scary.”\n\nA few months ago, Robinson left her car running when it was stolen and used in a bump and rob.\n\n“He actually used my car to hit another family, a husband and wife and two small children, in the back,” she said. “From what I heard, at gunpoint told them to get out of the car, fired the gun and took their vehicle. And used it in another wreck.”\n\nFernandez said drivers should be aware of their surroundings.\n\n“Lower the window a little bit. Lock your doors,” he said. “Evaluate, see if these people are quick to rush to your car. If they have something in their hands, like a weapon, then you want to leave there right away.”\n\nIf there are children in the car, let the other driver know.\n\n“At least put it out there and let them know,” Fernandez said. “I’ve got a child in the car. You take my child, you’re talking kidnapping.”\n\nPolice said most importantly, do what the thieves ask. Chances are good police will find the stolen vehicle.\n\nPolice have already solved a bump and rob that happened last week on Bell Road.\n\n“We want people to keep things in perspective,” Fernandez said. “We want everybody to be safe. It’s property, you can get that replaced.”\n\nPolice said as soon as they are in a fender bender, drivers should write down the license plate number and a few things about the occupants of the other vehicle. If they are approached by someone with a weapon who appears agitated, police said drivers should leave their keys and purse in the car, get out quickly, and leave the area immediately.
d969e80b-6b4a-4cda-ba5c-18c46b0fbd39	PM: Climate change refugee an overstayer \n             \nA Kiribati family due to be deported from New Zealand on Wednesday have no future back in the Pacific Island, says an advocate fighting to keep the family here. \n \nReverend Sumalie Naisali and members of the Kiribati and Tuvalu communities presented a petition to Labour and Green Party MPs on Tuesday calling for Ioane Teitota to remain in the country. \n \nTeitota has been in custody in Mt Eden Prison after his bid to claim climate change refugee status was dismissed last week. \n \nHe was arrested by police and immigration officials at his West Auckland home on Tuesday morning for overstaying his permit. \n \nAssociate Immigration Minister Craig Foss is yet to receive a briefing on the case, which is now being appealed on humanitarian reasons. \n \nFoss is expected to receive the briefing and make a decision on deportation by the end of Tuesday. \n \nPrime Minister John Key has called Teitota an "over-stayer" and said while Kiwis "feel for the guy" his case is not "unique". \n \n"If people were being forced out becasue of rising sea levles then I'd say it's a valid case but it's not like he can't return, he's an over-stayer." \n \nNaisali said there were no employment opportunities for the parents or education opportunities for their three children. \n \n"The wife is a teacher here in New Zealand and the chidlren are learning here in New Zealand. \n \n"For them to go back is just like putting someone on dialysis on a plane to fly to Fiji and something will happen to him on a plane," he said. \n \nNew Zealand and Australia must take climate change seriously and do more for smaller Pacific Island nations, Naisali said. \n \n"I think it's about time for us to stand up and say 'please do not make fun of this issue of climate change'. It's real and you must do something." \n \nHis comments come on the back of Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton being caught on tape joking about low-lying islands being swamped by rising seas. \n \nThis was only days after the Pacific Islands Forum in Papua New Guinea, where climate change was a key focus. \n \nFoss said the decision-making process could slow down Teitota's deportation, scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. \n \n"I have to make decisions like this every other day actually, some can be difficult but I have to abide by the rules that I have," he said. \n \n    \n \n    \n      \n    \nKey said the man's family situation and a plea to be allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds was a different issue to that of climate change.  \n \n"I, as an electorate MP sometimes do advocate for people, who have come to my electorate office for exactly those reasons; they're well ensconced in New Zealand, they're probably really good New Zealanders.  \n \n"But the only problem is we have a set of rules that say, you have to stick to those rules because basically the wheels fall off because everyone goes around the system," he said. \n \n"But I don't think that claiming he's a refugee based on climate change, that that's a credible argument."  \n \nThat may become a valid argument in the future, Key said. \n \n"We can't rule out what's going to happen 30, 40, 50 years from now. But some of the scientists are certainly predicting quite a rise in sea levels, and if that's the case then it will challenge those low lying states and we understand that." \n \nLabour leader Andrew Little said the Government needed to set up a framework to deal with the issue of climate change in the Pacific Islands. \n \n"We'll need the help of Australia, we'll need the help of other Pacific nations to do that." \n \n"One of the promises we made for our seat on the Security Council to Pacific island nations is 'we will help you on climate change issues.' \n \n"That's got to be real," he said. \n \nLabour MP for Te Atatu Phil Twyford is advocating on behalf of Teitoa and will collect a petition at Parliament on Tuesday calling for him and his family to be allowed to stay in the country. \n \nTwyford said the Government needed to "get real" about climate change because "it's happening". \n \n"I've asked Minister Craig Foss to intervene in this decision, as he's able to do on humanitarian grounds, to allow this family to stay." \n  \n 
981d477d-469f-4b90-906d-214d63506beb	Hemudu Relics, a neolithic cultural site located in the lower reaches of Yangtze Valley, got its name after that of Hemudu Town in Yuyao city of Zhejiang Province where the site was initially discovered. Hemudu Culture has been verified to range from 5000 B.C. to 3300 B.C.\nLiving utensils of Hemudu Culture mainly consist of pottery vessels, with a few wooden wares as supplementary. Stone tools are mostly ground artifacts but with little delicacy. In contrast, the making of bone wares reaches certain height. Some are even carved with exquisite patterns to be featured in both practicability and aesthetics. In agriculture, rice was planted to facilitate the possibility of storing up surplus grain, which led to the discrepancy between the rich and poor. Thus a new phase of civilization development unfolded itself. Besides, the primitive spinning wheels, bone needles and ceramics engraved with cloth lines have been unearthed, which reflect the progress of weaving skills in that period. Decorative objects made of jade and fluorite materials are in great variety and with refined craftsmanship, representing the level of neolithic culture. The red-lacquered bowl uncovered here, with a history of 7,000 plus years, is the earliest lacquer ware in China.\nThe inhabited areas in the age of Hemudu Culture were in the form of all-sized villages. Plenty of house foundations have been found at the relics, which deliver the message that the architecture at that time was mainly in stilt style. It is one of the important architectural forms in the south of the Yangtze River since the neolithic age and is enormously different from the half-crypt houses in north China in the same period. Up to date, Hemudu boasts the earliest stilt houses ever.\nHemudu Culture, not similar to Yangshao Culture of the Yellow River Valley, represents the civilization of Yangtze Valley in south China as another major thread going through the development of ancient Chinese culture. The discovery of Hemudu Relics has proved the fact that Neolithic culture situated in lower reaches of Yangtze River also serves as a principal origin of Chinese civilization.\nDetails Study of Hemudu Culture\nBone Ware\nThe production technique of bone ware in Hemudu Culture of the Neolithic Age is relatively advanced, boasting elaborately-made tools in the shape of spade-like plough, harpoon, arrowhead, whistle,...\nRice Culture\nThe social economy of Hemudu Culture features mainly cereal agriculture, while integrating the activities of animal husbandry, picking, fishing and hunting. Vestiges of paddies, chaffs, wheat...\nEarthen Bowl with Pig Pattern\nEarthen bowl with pig pattern is a piece of rectangle, round-cornered and flat-bottomed pottery carved with pig patterns on two faces of the outer bowl.\nStilt-style Architecture\nLarge numbers of stilt-style architecture relics are excavated in Hemudu Site.\nPrimitive Textile Industry\nThe weaving tools excavated from the Hemudu Site are abundant, especially the spinning wheels, 300 odd in number.\nTooth Sculpture\nThis bird-shaped tooth full-round sculpture is one of the first tooth sculptures in China.\nBird-Shaped Wine Utensil\nUnearthed from Hemudu site culture (Layer 2), it has a long history of 5500-6000 years.\nPottery Spindle\nUnearthed from the Hemudu sites, the pottery spindle fully demonstrates that people in Neolithic period has already master the spinning technique.\nPottery Kettle\nUnearthed from Hemudu site, the pottery kettle is made of charcoal-mixed black pottery.\nWooden Oars\nIn remote antiquity, most people lived by rivers and lakes.\nPottery Pig\nApart from rice farming, stock raising was also carried out on a fairly big scale by Hemudu Clan with pigs, dogs and buffalos being the main domestic animals.\nWhy Hemudu Culture Is Important to Early Neolithic Studies\nThe history of the Hemudu culture is extremely important to the study of early Neolithic cultures and the origins of rice cultivation.

82c0c1d4-45b1-4861-b880-c414de299948	I took the Man to his event this morning, which was a grueling miles-long loaded-rucksack hike with other vets. I really like the fact that he does stuff like this--challenges himself, stays fit, gets with his tribe, recharges himself in that way. I dropped him off and awaited him at the end hours later, armed with a sandwich and a lot of cold beer. He was exhausted and happy, that place you get into when you've done something that really challenges you and completed it, brought out the best of yourself. I could tell he was in a pretty deep space so I suggested that he go home and rest and let himself soak in the experience tonight. \nOn the way to drop him at his car, he informed me--in that funny way he does--that he'd had a lot of time to think on the hike, and presented me with a multilayered theory of what's going on with my life, how I haven't retained a boyfriend because I'm type A and they get freaked out (? I'm not sure if I remember correctly that that's what he said. In my own opinion, I just tend to wander away from guys who aren't nice, since I don't tend to volunteer a lot of information about myself in dating and it would therefore not usually be known that I have so many things going on unless you've known me for quite a while. I tell him things, but that's because he asks.) He also presented some thoughts and theories about my business, as well as letting me know that he's worried I don't sleep or eat enough. \nI was genuinely touched, surprised and amused, as I would think that on a miles long loaded rucksack hike, you'd mostly be thinking about how to get up the next hill, or where the next bathroom was, stuff like that. But, he is like that, he operates on multiple tracks. Perhaps contemplating the eccentricities of my life got his mind off the pain, eh? I have to admit that I didn't really manage to take it all in, as I was captaining a short drive in dinner hour traffic and the theory he presented was baklava-like in its complexity. I'm sure I'll hear more about it if he thinks about it some more and wants to continue. \nThen I went and had dinner with part of my adoptive family, the Flynn sisters; so good to see them and I'm giving the younger a Feldenkrais lesson tomorrow, something I used to do regularly as part of caring for three generations of their family. I've been invited to Albuquerque for a Flynn Christmas, and I'm thinking about doing it; somehow that 10 or 12 hour drive through northwest Texas is one of the magical spaces that seems to open up time. The last time I did it--to visit the Flynn brother and his wife, actually--I remember stopping at a big field full of tumbleweeds blown high against blackened wire fencing, just standing there for a long time, touching the thorny balls with my fingers, looking out over the amber and grey North Texas plains, traffic whizzing by on the road at my back. \nI always remember the way the long trains stretch into the curve of the desert for miles, the way it feels to drive alongside them into what feels like eternity; the lonely vastness of magical New Mexico space, earth meeting sky.

e70f708c-eb4f-4a8f-97ec-8f50e865ad06	(NEW YORK) — An elderly man’s sweet serenade to his dying wife while in hospice care is warming the hearts of viewers across the globe. \n \nErin Solari of New Orleans, videotaped her grandfather Howard Serena, 92, singing “You’ll Never Know” by Rosemary Clooney and Harry James to his wife Laura, 93, on Sept. 12. Laura currently suffers from dementia. \n \n“We knew that this was probably the last time, so we wanted to capture that moment,” Solari told ABC News on Monday. “It was really loving. \n \n“For me, right after the video, I was so overcome,” Solari added. “I broke down and started crying. I was so happy that I’d captured this moment for my family. It touched me, so it doesn’t surprise me that it touched other people as well.” \n \nThe Gainesville, Florida, couple have nine children and 18 grandchildren. They’ve been married for 73 years. \n \n“This video is pretty awesome because she’s almost completely blind and he’s fairly deaf, so it’s difficult for them to communicate,” Solari said. “This kind of thing between them, singing to each other, wasn’t uncommon in our family. They were always singing and dancing and they’d be very vibrant in that way.” \n \nIn the video, Howard strokes his wife’s face as he sings. Laura looks at her husband and mouths the lyrics. \n \nSolari’s heart-warming video was a hit on social media. \n \n“It [the video] was posted minutes after it happened on Facebook and it had over three million views,” she said. “I know it seems private, but my family is very proud and happy to share this love with the world. As for the feedback, all the love and support we’ve gotten, being around my grandmother, I believe it maybe it had a little bit of an impact of her feeling better. She’s been able to go home and we are very appreciative of that as well.” \n \nAfter being told the video had gone viral, Laura remarked: “I told you Howard that I’d make you famous.” \n \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.

7e5f4072-b69f-4819-8ed6-62bdd0100621	Jerusalem - Israel Approves Harsher Measures For Stone And Firebomb Throwers Published on: Today 01:57 PM By: Jerusalem Post Text Size   Email Post Print Post Comments (1)\tSave Article Jerusalem - The Israeli security cabinet approved a short menu of tougher steps against rock and firebomb throwers on Thursday, including the easing of open-fire regulations. The unanimous decision of the 10-member security cabinet was taken after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a number of high-level consultations over the last month with security and legal officials looking for ways to combat the wave of violence in Jerusalem and rock and petrol-bomb attacks on the roads to Jerusalem and beyond the Green Line.\nAdvertisement: Speaking after the meeting, Netanyahu said the first decision was to “sharpen” the open fire regulations. If until now the police could only fire if their own lives were in danger, now they will be able to open fire if anyone’s lives are in danger, he said. In addition, the police will be able to use the low-powered Ruger sniper rifle, something that up until now has only been permitted for IDF use in the territories.  Secondly, Netanyahu said it was decided that a minimum four years prison sentence will be imposed on those over the age of 18 caught throwing lethal objects. In addition, he said, minimum fines and punishments will be set for minors. “We intend to change the norm that has taken root here where it is possible to throw lethal and murderous objects in Israel without an answer or impediment. This will change,” he said. The security cabinet decision includes taking measures to punish minors from the age of 14-18 with jail sentences and fines on their parents, as well as taking away national security benefits for minors in jail. Likewise, it was decided to look into whether it was legally possible to impose minimum fines on parents of minors from the age of 12-14, and to have parents of children under the age of 12 post bonds for a year to secure their children’s release. Even as the security cabinet was formulating its new policies, the Jerusalem police’s 10-day crackdown on rock and firebomb-throwing Palestinians netted 137 arrests in the eastern portion of the capital by Thursday, as security preparations were finalized for coinciding Muslim and Jewish holidays. The massive sweep – undertaken ahead of Sukkot and the Muslim festival of Id al-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice), lasting from Thursday to Tuesday – follows chronic rioting after the Defense Ministry banned two radical Muslim groups from the Temple Mount earlier this month. The latest round of rioting took place over Yom Kippur in Beit Hanina, Pisgat Ze’ev and Talpiot, Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said, although no arrests were made and no injuries were reported. According to Rosenfeld, the most recent arrests occurred overnight Wednesday, when 13 suspects were apprehended in the flashpoint Arab neighborhoods of Silwan, Ras al-Amud, Isawiya, Shuafat and A-Tur. Of the 137 suspects arrested, Rosenfeld said 76 are adults, while the remaining 61 are minors as young as 14. “Police will continue operations and find suspects involved in disturbances over the last few days in different neighborhoods of the capital,” he said on Thursday. Additionally, Rosenfeld said security has been markedly heightened in the Old City for Id al-Adha, which celebrates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael, and often involves the slaughter of sheep for consumption at celebratory meals. In an effort to ease ongoing tensions, the Defense Ministry said that no age restrictions will be applied on the Temple Mount for Muslims with Israeli identification cards, while married Palestinian men from the West Bank aged 45 and older will be allowed to enter. “We completed security measures in order to prevent further incidents in Jerusalem and the Old City for the Muslim festival of Id al-Adha, with an emphasis in and around different Arab neighborhoods,” said Rosenfeld. “Security arrangements have been made to allow thousands of Muslims to go to the Temple Mount, with extra units in the Old City to patrol all activity.”  Jewish visitors will temporarily be barred from the contested holy site during the Muslim holiday. In the meantime, Rosenfeld said security preparations for Sukkot have also been finalized.

d6880afb-7fcb-4576-9d17-cedd343677f9	ATHENS, Georgia (CNN) – Jeb Bush was scheduled to walk right up to a small stage and give brief remarks at a tailgate on Saturday, followed by photos with students before going to the Georgia vs. South Carolina game in Athens. \n\nBut when the Republican presidential candidate ventured into the tailgate space here on campus, it took him 24 minutes to inch through a thick swarm of students and fans to get to the stage. \n\nThe enthusiastic sea of mostly UGA supporters — armed in red Bulldogs swag and smart phones — crowded around Bush to get a look at the former Florida governor, but most importantly, to get a selfie. \n\nHis staffers gently tried to usher him through the crowd, but his campaign was more than happy to let the candidate take as many photos as requested, knowing most of the pictures would end up on social media — thus, free advertising. \n\n“Just get ’em all on Facebook,” Bush said jokingly at one point. “Tweet ’em!” \n\nIt’s common for Bush to talk and take photos with audience members at his events. And while he spent more than four hours at the Iowa State Fair last month, he had yet to experience a continuous stream of fanfare like he saw on Saturday, where he was given rock star treatment from the crushing mob of people for more than 70 minutes. \n\nHis visit to Athens marked the first of three SEC football games that Bush will attend this fall, all part of an effort to court voters in the March 1 primary that will involve eight Southern states and deliver the nominating season’s first huge haul of delegates in one day. \n\nAfter he worked his way to the stage, he was met by Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who endorsed Bush last month and introduced the candidate as someone who “stands for everything that the party needs to be espousing.” \n\nBush, with signs behind him that tweaked his “Jeb!” campaign logo to look like the SEC logo, spoke for only three minutes. “I’m going to be very brief because I really like taking selfies,” he said to big cheers from the crowd. \n\nThe candidate performed a condensed version of his stump speech, promising to grow the economy by 4.4% so that students can get jobs when they graduate and buy homes. “A conservative can win the presidency and then fix these things so that you all will have a chance to live a great life,” he said. \n\nThen it was back to selfies for another 50 minutes. \n\nFollowing his widely praised performance at the CNN debate on Wednesday, Bush hasn’t been as eager to bring up contrasts with his rival, Donald Trump, by name in his speeches as he has been in recent weeks. \n\nStill, Bush jumped at the chance to mock Trump at one point Saturday when a voter near him commented on Bush being “high energy.” The former governor whipped around to follow up: “Very high energy!” \n\nFriday night at an event in Michigan, Bush pounced on the latest controversy involving Trump and a supporter who argued at a rally this week that the president was a Muslim and questioned his status as an American. Bush defended Obama on Friday night, asserting that he was an American and a Christian. \n\nThe initial incident, which Trump didn’t try to correct or denounce, renewed dialogue about tension in the United States between Muslims and non-Muslims. \n\n“I don’t think that there’s a problem with Muslims in America,” Bush told reporters Saturday. “I think there’s a problem with Islamic terrorism in the rest of the world and we need to confront that.” \n\nBush added that “of course” Obama was born in the United States. Pressed on whether Trump should apologize for not calling out the questioner at his rally, Bush declined to weigh in further. \n\n“I’m not really, I’m here watching the football game. Donald Trump’s not really on my mind anymore,” he said. \n\nThough the two quarreled Wednesday night in the debate, they also high-fived each other toward the end. Bush said Saturday that he doesn’t hold any “personal animus” against Trump, but when asked whether Trump should still apologize to his wife for invoking her in the debate about immigration, Bush said: “Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.” \n\nThis week, Bush also got some attention from younger voters after he admitted on the debate stage that he smoked marijuana four decades ago. “I’m sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people,” he said, looking around at his rivals on stage. “My mom’s not happy that I just did.” \n\nAsked Saturday whether he had heard from his mother yet, Bush said he tried calling the former first lady this week but she wasn’t available. “Thankfully, she wasn’t there,” he said. “I think she’ll forgive me after 42 years, you think?” \n\nWith a few crushed beer cans on the grass around him and the smell of alcohol in the air, it was clear that at least some of the enthusiasm at the boisterous tailgate was owed to normal game day libations. Only water was served at the event, but anyone was free to wander over and several came with drinks in tow. \n\nBush politely advised a couple of young people to pace themselves.”Slow down there,” he said to one young woman who was keenly fascinated with a sticker on his shirt. “We haven’t even gotten to kickoff yet.” \n\nAs for who the candidate was rooting for at the game, Bush said he was neutral, though he predicted Georgia would beat the Gamecocks. \n\n“I think Georgia’s going to win the SEC East,” he added, as he was taking photos with a few South Carolina fans. \n\nThe Georgia fans quickly broke out into loud cheers: “Jeb for 2

3deea828-e3a1-4c4d-9a90-482cabc020d8	NBC's new drama The Player  has one of the most ridiculous premises of any of the new fall TV shows -- but that's not a bad thing. Unlike so many of the shows trying to "cut through the clutter" with a splashy concept, The Player knows exactly what it wants to be: a high-octane crime thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously. And it shouldn't with a setup like this: Alex Kane ( Philp Winchester ) is a private security specialist in Las Vegas who, after the murder of his wife Ginny ( Daisy Betts ), is pulled into a long-running conspiracy involving the richest people in the world gambling on crime. With the help of "pit boss" Mr. Johnson ( Wesley Snipes ) and "the dealer" Cassandra ( Charity Wakefield ), Alex, as "the player," tries to stop crimes while the fat cats in "the house" bet on or against his ability to save the day. Got all that? "We knew we wanted to make a pulp show," co-creator John Rogers tells TVGuide.com . "The way pulp works is to find a good, simple, defining metaphor, and we said, 'What are the elements of gambling?' If you're going to have a conspiracy, you're going to have code names, you're going to a have a structure. When we looked at the basic form of gambling, the feel of a casino, and it just came very naturally. People understand those terms -- millions of people gamble. We're not introducing obscure vocabulary to explain our very high-concept, obscure conspiracy." Fall Preview: Check out all the must-watch new shows But it was also important for Rogers to have some emotional context beneath all the Las Vegas window-dressing. "Everyone right now feels as if maybe the rules were changed on them," Rogers says. "You sent your kids to college, but somehow your college graduate is living in your basement because he can't get a job. It feels like we're trapped in a game that somebody changed the rules. We said, 'Why don't we externalize that? Why don't we talk about the fact we are trapped in a game, and there's one guy in the middle of it who is on our side?' That gave us the emotional stakes of the show." Page 2 of 3 - For Alex, his journey is entirely fueled by the heartbreak he feels over the death of his wife. "Trying to resolve how Ginny died and why she died and who's responsible, is the primary emotional thrust of his investigation," Rogers says. "That's the thing that keeps him going back undercover into this organization." And continuing to go back in is an issue. After all, the whole concept of a group of people profiting off of crime rather than trying to prevent it is pretty icky, right? "They're doing a horrible thing," Rogers says with a laugh. "It allows us to have some fun every week, but they're plainly bad guys. Alex is a good guy in the middle of a bad system. One of the essential questions of the show is: Is that system actually the best possible system that we can live with?" Because of Alex's unease about what he's doing, The Player is unlike most procedurals where the team is one big happy family. Instead, when, in the pilot, Alex threatens to kill Mr. Johnson one day in the not-too-distant future, you're inclined to believe him. However, the team still has to rely on each other, regardless of how much they trust their colleagues. "Everyone has their own agenda, everyone has their own secret plan, and everyone has their own sort of shifting allegiances," Rogers says. "They are in a life-and-death world, and they have to trust each other as far as they can to not die, but never trust each other enough to make themselves vulnerable." The Player 's Wesley Snipes and more familiar faces in new places That central conflict will certainly begin to define Mr. Johnson's moral ambiguity, which is exactly what attracted Snipes to the role. "I get to explore some character work in a way that I probably couldn't in a feature film," Snipes says. "You never know which side he's playing for. You'll learn quickly that Mr. Johnson knows secrets that no one else knows. He's seen a lot of players come and go, and this guy is nothing special at this point. Or so we make it appear. Mr. Johnson has another card that he hasn't played yet. There's a whole deck that Mr. Johnson hasn't played yet." However, Rogers is quick to caution people from deciding outright that Mr. Johnson is the bad guy. "There are weeks that Mr. Johnson does something heroic because it fits his sense of personal ethics, and you're like, 'Yeah, I love Mr. Johnson!'" Rogers says. "Then, there are days that he's the most horrible human being in the world. I don't know if you ever want to be rooting for him, but you should be fascinated by him. ... His views on power are not necessarily wrong, they're just horrible." Page 3 of 3 - Then again, Alex isn't an entirely noble hero either. "He's saving lives. He genuinely enjoys the work, but Alex Kane has a problem. He is a man with a high capacity for violence and a tendency towards it," Rogers says. "To a great degree the two themes for the show are power and addiction. We all have behaviors we're drawn to. We all have those things we can't let go of, be it Ginny's death or the constant fall into violence which comes very easily to him. We all have these desires that are beyond our control, and how we deal with them to a great degree is what defines us." Although the show is clearly reveling in its procedural makeup ("I love the one-and-done of it," Rogers confesses), the writers are telling a longer story. However, the central mystery of Ginny's murder, which gets much more messy by the end of the pilot, won't be stretched out forever. "The mystery of how that happened, who did it, why it was done -- all of that is meant to be an important thing that we reveal to the audience over the course of the first 12 episodes," Rogers says. "We're not going to hold you over a barrel for five years. Most of the questions in the first season will be resolved by the end of the first season." The Player premieres Thursday at 10/9c on NBC.

507d552f-db6a-495e-b78a-95783cad9af1	In a telling example of police incompetence, a poor woman has been repeatedly subject to cops raiding her house in a futile attempt to arrest her dead husband. In 1996, James Jordan Sr. was arrested for jumping a turnstile in New York’s subway. A decade would pass without police pursuing him and in 2006, Jordan would succumb to his diabetes and died at the age of 46. It wasn’t until he died that officers began looking for this turnstile-jumping hardened criminal, and they did so by harassing his widow. In 2014 alone, cops would tear apart the apartment of Karen Fennell four times as they searched for her dead husband who was wanted on a misdemeanor charge almost two decades ld.The repeated raids had gotten so out of hand that Fennell was forced to hang her dead husband’s death certificate and funeral flyer on the front door. But still, police came into her home and turned furniture upside down looking for this deceased man. “I wanted it to be the first thing they saw before they came into my home and flipped it upside down,” Fennell told The Post of her morbid posting. “I can’t hide anyone in my apartment. It’s not big enough for that. But they keep coming and insisting that he’s in my house.” After being harassed by countless teams of incompetent NYPD cops Fennell hired an attorney and filed a lawsuit. Last week, Fennell had enough stress of reliving her husband’s death and settled with the city for $10,000. While Fennell’s case may seem like a fluke, the fact is that police raid the homes of innocent people in attempts to locate suspects who do not live there, all the time. Not only do they raid the wrong house, but in some instances they even kill the innocent occupants.  Perhaps the saddest aspect of Fennell’s story is that this settlement will likely have little if any effect on the NYPD. They may very well show up at her house tomorrow.

3011fed2-1784-47f8-834c-c1f1af79e476	UPDATED Uber says Melbourne protests are being led by investors not taxi drivers. \n\nUber has hit back at claims that its entry into Australia is hurting taxi drivers and small investors who hold taxi plates.\n\nTo get more Money more often, why not follow us on Twitter? We’re @FairfaxMoney \n\nTaxi drivers have been protesting in Melbourne this morning but the anger is felt by the taxi industry across the country. Some drivers say that they find it hard to compete with ride-sharing in their own cars. And investors who have put their life savings into owning taxi plates have seen their stakes shrink.\n\nBut despite the protests, Uber is bullish about its operations.\n\nA spokesperson said: "The leaders of these protests are taxi investors, not drivers."\n\n"These same investors are the ones who have kept drivers' wages low and working conditions poor for decades before Uber arrived.\n\n"Instead of improving their own business, these plate owners are blaming others," the spokesperson said.\n\nUber is not to blame for taxi drivers' poor working conditions and taxi industry data shows that "the taxi market has grown since Uber arrived," the spokesperson said.\n\nOne Brisbane taxi driver, Ross, who recently contacted Money, said he gets upset with ride-sharing because people do not understand the costs that go into a taxi.\n\nThere are the cameras that taxis have to have and car insurance of $6000 a year and "security" fees of $600 a year. And that is before the taxi driver put the keys into the ignition.\n\nHe said he has just put a new Toyota Aurion on the road at a cost of $46,000 and in Brisbane you see old Corollas being used for ride-sharing.\n\nAn older reader from NSW who does not want to be identified said he and his wife bought a taxi plate so that they would not have to go on to the pension.\n\nBut the value of the investment has fallen due to ride-sharing.\n\nThe retirees first bought a taxi plate in 2006 and it was worth about $440,000 in 2008. He reckons it is now worth about $320,000 or less because of ride-sharing.\n\nUber \n\n"It is an illegal taxi service that should be banned in this state as it has been in many cities and states of the world," he said.\n\nData supplied to Money by Uber shows that about 30 per cent of Victorian taxi plate holders actually drive their own taxi, the rest are owned by a few big investors, some of whom hold hundreds of licences.\n\nIn NSW about one-quarter of taxi plate holders actually operate their taxi, almost half are held by those who own more than one and some investors hold over 300.\n\nThe Uber spokesperson said the time has come for political leaders to implement sensible, safety-based ride-sharing regulation as quickly as possible.\n\n@jcollett_money The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
340bb625-bb7e-49af-aa8d-781e5762f7a3	Peter Edelstein M.D. Patient Power My Dad Deserves to Die Why California’s recent assisted suicide legislation doesn’t go far enough. Posted Sep 18, 2015 SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL I remember sitting by her side, tears running down my cheeks, as her doctor returned her to me.  He had just given her the medication that would within minutes quietly take her from us, allowing her to pass away peacefully.  I loved her, and my heart ached, but I knew that this was best for her.  That the loss of her eyesight, her failing liver, her difficulty breathing as the fluid collected in her abdomen and lungs, her painful arthritic hips, all had finally made living much less appealing than dying surrounded by loved ones.  We were her family and owed it to her to help her die.  Because she couldn’t make the decision for herself.  And so I had forced myself to abandon all of the selfish reasons I had been using for months to avoid arriving at this day, and I did what I knew she would want me to do. Euthanizing my dog, who my then-fiancée and I had adopted from the shelter when she was only nine weeks old, who had been part of our new life together, who had eagerly waited for us to bring each of our newborn daughters home, who had played and slept with us for close to two decades, was the right thing to do.  Loving pet owners euthanize their furry family members every day, to no outcry and with popular understanding and support. Last week, the California legislature sent their governor a bill which seeks to make the Golden State the 5th in the country to legalize “assisted suicide” (following Oregon, Montana, Washington, and Vermont).  For many physicians like myself who have had the privilege of caring for terminally ill patients and their families, that such legislation has not passed in all fifty states is tragic.  To address credible concerns of misuse and abuse, there are numerous checks and balances built into these laws (such as the California bill’s requirements that two physicians independently agree that the patient has no more than six months to live, and that the patient himself or herself be able to swallow the fatal medications unassisted).  Not to mention the ultimate check against misuse:  that the patient must be deemed mentally competent to actively request assistance in life termination. Yet it is this final requirement of mental competency which is so unfortunate and unfair to thousands of terminally ill patients and their loved ones.  I speak from deeply personal experience.  My father, once a bright, warm, and gentle loving dad, husband, physician, and educator, has suffered from Alzheimer’s disease for close to two decades.  Ultimately, his Alzheimer’s made living independently with my mother (with my family down the street) unsafe and impossible, and so he has been in an Assisted Living Dementia Unit for seven years.  Over the last two years, his condition has deteriorated dramatically, and today, Dad lies in bed 24/7, communicating with no one and entirely expressionless, other than the automatic smile he now rarely displays if awake when my mom comes in the room (as she does several times a day).  He otherwise is entirely non-interactive, sitting stiff and staring at the ceiling with glazed eyes.  He is fed, washed, and toileted by nurses. My father has, in reality, already died.  But he has left his skin-and-flesh shell behind, a shell which will ultimately stop breathing and no longer generate a heartbeat as a direct result of Alzheimer’s disease (an estimated half-a-million Americans die from Alzheimer’s every year).  But for our family, and especially for my mother (his wife of more than fifty years), the lingering of Dad’s soul-less body day after day, week after week, and now year after year, is a painful, punishing, insult to the memory of my father.  And it represents exactly what my dad, once a passionate physician and beloved teacher (as well as loving father and grandfather) clearly told his wife and family he did not wish to ever be allowed to happen.  Long before his Alzheimer’s set in, he and Mom on several occasions discussed such a potential future (as Alzheimer’s runs in his side of the family).  He articulated that should he become mentally and physically dysfunctional (conditions which he met almost two years ago), he wished for her to help him end his life with dignity.  Now at 84 years of age, if he was suffering from advanced stage cancer, heart disease, or other terminal condition which did not alter his mental status, my father (a California resident) could (assuming the governor signs the bill) opt to end his suffering through legalized assisted suicide.  But despite the fact that hospice professionals are now certain that Dad will pass away in the next six months, because his terminal disease will kill him through progressive brain damage, which has robbed him of his mental competency (as well as his ability to physically function), he cannot take advantage of the California legislature’s recent show of legislative compassion and end an existence which he desperately wished to avoid.  End the endless misery suffered by my mom, his wife, who must witness the spiritless shell which has now replaced her life partner, devoid of all personality, soul, life.  And her guilt at not being able to fulfill his last wish, that he not linger on like this day after day, week after week, year after year, overwhelms her.  Her attorney and Dad’s Assisted Living team have assured her that despite her having his Medical Power of Attorney, there’s nothing that can be done.  More than five million Americans currently suffer from Alzheimer’s disease, which is the most common but only just one form of dementia.  And the Alzheimer’s population is growing dramatically as our population (and that of the world) ages.  Assisted suicide legislation is a good start to accepting the responsibility of a compassionate and honest society in dealing with end-of-life issues, and such legalization represents the right option to offer Americans throughout this great nation.  However, it is not too early to recognize the need to expand the opportunity for Americans nearing the end of their lives to choose a dignified, peaceful exit from this world in the presence of their loved ones.  Thousands of once mentally competent husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters whose terminal illnesses through no fault of their own compromise their mental faculties should not have to suffer the indignity of punishing their family and friends through slow, tortuous death spirals.  Surely we can expand legalized assisted suicide to allow any and all of us to clearly define under what circumstances we wish to be eased from our pain if no longer mentally competent to make such a decision.  Checks and balances can be built in at the time that a mentally competent person requests the option for assisted suicide should they lose their mental competency in the future.  And we must trust in those who love the patient to act in their best interest in accordance with the patient’s previously defined guidance. After all, it’s the right thing to do for our beloved dogs and cats.  How can it not be the right thing to offer our dads and moms?

But the people along the way have been fantastic and have helped lift my spirits when the going has got tough." \n \nAs well as aiming to spread the word of God, Mr Cornish - who attends New Life Church in Fairwater - said he also helps prisoners at HMP Prescoed near Bridgend with weekly visits. \n \n"I know what it's like to be inside and have that feeling that no-one likes you and the world is against you," he added. \n \n"It can be so easy for people to fall into a pattern of reoffending and breaking out of it can be difficult. \n \n"We all have issues in life - the things which affected me from my past still do. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n"But I want to show people that there is another path and a way out. \n \n"It's all too easy to criticise people when you haven't walked in their footsteps. I think we need to be more compassionate towards people and if my walk can inspire a single person to change or be kinder to someone then that's an achievement."

Nicole///////\nNicole, YOU SAID the Lutheran church was named BY HIM.....IT WAS NOT. Also He did not leave, he was excommunicated......two entirely different matters. Do you think Martin Luther was the ONLY person who questioned the evil the RCC had become? Hardly Nicole. Luther wanted CHANGE within the RCC, and rightly so. The RCC became wealthy off the backs of peasants, and corruption within, even to today as we see Pope Francis is still cleaning CORRUPTION out of the RCC. Makes me wonder what would have been the outcome if Pope Francis was Pope at the time of Luther. ---kathr4453 on 9/20/15 Nicole, we also know the RCC in these past years have had a mass exodus because of the evil of pedophiles the Church was covering up and even protecting. EGO again has nothing to do with calling evil evil. It's called CONSCIENCE. It's called righteousness, it's called TRUTH. The history of the Borgas is also well known. Telling poor souls they can PAY for the deceased in pergetory is pure corruption. BUT the RCC needed money to buy back property lost in a poker game and came up with that. You hate that Luther EXPOSED all this corruption? And 99 in all. Because of the reformation the RCC was forced to clean their own house, but ONLY AFTER their corruption was exposed. You should be thanking Martin Luther. ---kathr453 on 9/20/15 1 Peter 1:18-19\n18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers,\n19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:\nWe see Nicole that SCRIPTURE Clearly shows one cannot buy another's soul out of a fictitious place.

Change the context and subject of the conversation? Just say, OK I was wrong. But no Nicloe you can't do that can you. You had to instead spew all sorts of hate and put YOUR twist on it insisting now his EGO really liked it, AND that he had the power to stop the RCC from naming those they called heretics after the heretic. This is why it's hard to debate with you Nicole, because when you are shown the truth, you can't just accept it at face value. YOU have to LIE and TWIST the truth to somehow insist YOU were right all along. But worse yet is your obvious HATRED of Luther. Were you there Nicole? Isn't the truth Luther was excommunicated? ---kathr4453 on 9/19/15 Luther through reading scripture had an awakening of CONSCIENCES, after reading Romans ( proving the Word of God is LIVING AND POWERFUL AND STRONGER THAN A TWO EDGE SWORD) again proving scripture that those who SEEK will find the truth. There is a difference between SEEKERS, and those who just follow and believe what they are told. Luther never insisted others follow him, but gave others the same opportunity of being able to read the Bible for themselves, where FAITH COMES BY HEARING THE WORD OF GOD. Not hearing the word of man. You can't LEGALIZE FAITH. If perchance you understood that Nicole, you would be a seeker and not a follower. ---kathr453 on 9/19/15 Nicole you proved your point that Luther and the Lutheran church.\nBut he followed the Teachings of Paul and left the traditions of men.

His grandmother Nora was an Amphlett, one of ten children born to William and Ellen Amphlett of Mill Cottage, Castlemorton. \n \nHe says the Amphletts were known as "river people" because they always lived in the Severn vale, accounting for the title of his book. \n \nHe recalls visiting his Auntie Elsie and Uncle Jim at Malvern Link on a Black and White coach that would deposit him outside the Malvern Link Co-op two hours after leaving Wolverhampton. \n \nHe said: "Here Uncle Jim (Roan), a big, quiet man, who had been a ganger on the railway, met us to help carry the cases to their council house in Duke of Edinburgh Way. \n \n"Auntie Elsie was a sister of my grandmother Nora. Nora had married William Averill, from Bromesberrow, who saw service in the First World War on HMS Tiger, taking part in the Battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland. His brother Thomas served with the Herefordshire Regiment, died of wounds in 1918, and is recorded on the Bromesberrow war memorial. \n   Promoted stories   \n"Our stay in Malvern always included visits to great aunts and great uncles. Amongst the older family was Uncle Arthur, foreman at Great Malvern Station. \n \n"We would catch a bus into Great Malvern, and here the Priory Church was a beautiful attraction, as was Priory Park, particularly if I was let loose in one of the children’s paddle boats. \n \n"There were walks up to the summit of the Worcestershire Beacon, with the welcome little café which used to look out from the top. \n \n"There seemed to be a good choice of Midland Red buses to reach different places in those days, for instance the Wyche Cutting, and the British Camp Hotel. \n \n"From here we would set off up the Herefordshire Beacon, and I would always have to find the Giant’s Cave, just to say that I had been inside it. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n"We even went as far as walking the whole length of the Malvern Hills one day.

14c446d0-bce8-47d3-ab97-583aee3bd859	Dear Dr. Carson,\n \n I write to express my disappointment at best for your statements on the NBC Sunday broadcast of "Meet the Press" on September 20, 2015. Host Chuck Todd raised the controversy surrounding Donald Trump's failure to correct an audience member in a town hall meeting in New Hampshire last week who asserted that President Obama is a Muslim, and then he advocated for the forceful deportation of Muslims from the U.S. Todd then asked you about your take on the controversy, to which you replied that a Muslim should not become president of our country: "I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that."\n \n As a highly educated person, as a candidate for the presidency, and as someone who has co-authored, along with your wife Candy, a book titled A More Perfect Union: What We the People Can Do to Reclaim Our Constitutional Liberties, you should have a more enlightened understanding of our nation's foundational document. \n \n In the book you write generally about the "basic principles" of the Constitution and how "they relate to our everyday lives." You go on to state: "I believe that making a difference starts with understanding our amazing founding document, the U.S. Constitution." You assert that both you and Candy wrote the book to "help defend" the Constitution "from those who misinterpret and undermine it." \n \n Well, now I'm really confused! How can you inform others and "help defend" the Constitution when you do not have even a basic understanding? Your recorded statements indicate that you have misinterpreted and undermined the document. If this were not the case, you would not have made your blatantly Islamophobic assertions on "Meet the Press," especially when Todd asked you, "So do you believe that Islam is consistent with the Constitution," and you replied, "No, I don't. I do not." \n \n Your answer leads me to believe that you practice a version of "cafeteria Constitutionalism" picking and choosing which of the passages should refer to which groups of people. Since you are a Christian follower of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, I am assuming that you are not placing Article VI of the US Constitution on your cafeteria tray: "No religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States." In addition, you seem to want to delete the First Amendment from the menu and toss it down the garbage disposal: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ..."\n \n When Donald Trump makes his racist and xenophobic statements about immigrants, and when he throws misogynistic tantrums about women, and when he does not correct questioners about President Obama's religion and birth status, I am not particularly surprised since Trump has centered his entire campaign on issues and discussions based on hate and fear that seem to have resonated with the base of the Republican Party. \n \n You Dr. Carson, in fact, appear to practice the same sort of despicable tactics as Donald Trump (as well as many others with whom you share the debate stage and the clown car as you all drive down the path toward the presidential primaries). I see an underlying philosophical trend among many of you Republican candidates, whether on issues around immigration, issues of equity between genders and sexual identities, and issues of religion. \n \n Once people like yourselves have entered the doorway of opportunity, you attempt to close the door in the face of others. All of the candidates are citizens of the United States, so now you want to close the door of citizenship to others. Since you all have quality healthcare, you want to take it away from the estimated 16 million people who now have health insurance for the first time under the Affordable Care Act. Though you may assume that all presidents since George Washington have followed Christian faiths -- though some have defined themselves instead as "Deists" -- you want to close the door of the office to anyone other than those of you with verified Christian credentials. \n \n Dr. Carson, you are running for the presidency by standing on the shoulders of the brave and tireless pioneers who came before you who made it possible for you and for Mr. Obama. I still remember seeing on television the lunch counter sit-ins, the voting rights registration drives, the "Freedom Schools," the marches, and the many other forms of civil disobedience aimed at abolishing discriminatory and abusive "Jim Crow" laws, which advanced and strengthened white supremacy by maintaining segregation and withholding the ballot from people of color. \n \n Your statements and those of many of your challengers on the Republican side of the political spectrum are replicating discriminatory policies by advancing and strengthening Christian supremacy by maintaining segregation and withholding opportunities from non-Christians, in particular, Muslims. How "Constitutional" Dr. Carson are these actions? \n \n In your book you write: "And as someone who has performed brain surgery thousands of times, I can assure you that the Constitution isn't brain surgery." Well, Dr. Carson, maybe you need to rethink your candidacy, and instead keep your day job, since you understand much better the structures of the brain instead of how to use it to defend and preserve the Constitution of the United States of America. \n-- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

183de50d-7772-44a2-9801-0739ef896f3e	1. If nothing else, you should see Everest on as big a screen as possible. I was fortunate enough to see it in 3-D on a digital IMAX screen—not the same as the IMAX format, mind you, there’s a difference , but still, you know, big—and I’m glad I did. The most you can hope for from a movie about Mount Everest is that it gives you a simulacrum of the experience of being on Mount Everest, and I can say that this movie absolute does. My theater actually began to feel cold  after a while. There are some story and narrative issues here, and it goes on too long and ends too many times, but it has an awe and respect for the mountain itself that is undeniable. The fundamental lesson of Mt. Everest is that it is bigger than humanity, bigger than life. This movie conveys that all too well. \n \n2. Everest tells the tale of the famous 1996 expedition that led (spoiler?) to the deaths of 12 people during a sudden blizzard. That disaster was the basis of Jon Krakauer’s 1997 book Into Thin Air , but, because some of the families and people involved weren’t crazy about every detail in Krakauer’s book, many of them wrote books themselves, and those are the basis of this film. (This might explain why Krakauer, played well here by Michael Kelly, occasionally comes off as weak and even cowardly.) We meet two groups of climbers, led by Rob (Jason Clarke) and Scott (Jake Gyllenhaal), who combine forces to guide their amateur clients to the peak of Everest during the annual two-week window. It all goes well at first, or as well as doing something as insane as climbing Mount Everest can go (Rob makes sure to remind us that “your body is dying at that height”), but then they stay a little too long up there, and the storm comes, and then it all falls apart. \n   \n   \n3. The first hour of Everest works splendidly. The film is impressively interested in the nuts and bolts of what goes into an Everest climb, and it’s fun to follow along with the trip, to see the risks involved and how guides like Rob and Scott actually constructed such an adventure. You understand the base camps, and the stopping points, and the landmarks that the climbers have to hit as they progress up the mountain; I certainly couldn’t make such a climb—I can barely make it up an escalator—but the movie helps show the amount of work and planning that goes into such a trip. It also does an excellent job of explaining why anyone would do this to themselves. We see the wonder and passion through the eyes of Buck (Josh Brolin), a brash Texan who’s secretly only able to stave off his depression on the mountain; Yasuko (Naoko Mori), a middle-aged Japanese woman who has scaled six of the planet’s seven highest summits and just has this one to go; and, most movingly, Doug (John Hawkes), a modest mailman who wants to show schoolkids at home just how much anyone can accomplish, if only you never quit. These aren’t fully fleshed-out characters, necessarily, but they’re enough to do the trick. You see why they want to do this, and you want them to succeed. \n \n4. Most of the rest of the human-scale business doesn’t work, though. It’s possible the filmmakers felt a little too respectful of the families; many of their backstories feel obligatory and rote, perhaps too unspectacular for the grandeur of the mountain. The tale of Everest is not about a man trying to be a better husband and father; it’s the awesome power of nature to remind us of our total insignificance, of our fragility. It can be hard to look at the mountain, that mountain, and worry much about how much that one random guy misses his kids. Rob, our hero, has a pregnant wife he has left behind, and while that’s sad and “raises the stakes” dramatically—and while I appreciate the real-life people involved—it still doesn’t make the scenes of Keira Knightley lying on her couch crying and waiting to hear word on her husband any more compelling. I’m sure she is very worried, but I’d like to maybe get back to the mountain, please? Mt. Everest makes all human life look small and pointless. That’s why so many want to conquer it. But it also makes their stories look perfunctory in comparison. Everest cares not of your daddy issues. \n \n5. With this many characters to address and this many fates to be resolved, the movie loses considerable moment in its back half, right when it’s supposed to be finding its finishing kick. Again, this is another issue of hewing too close to the real-life story: The movie feels obliged to make sure everyone is accounted for, which is admirable but begins to feel a bit inert after a while. (I was expected to feel sad a couple of times for characters I didn’t exactly remember meeting.) The two leads, Clarke and Gyllenhaal, are both strong, charismatic actors, and they’re both able to carve out striking impressions even in the wake of the mountain. But I didn’t learn anything about either character, and the movie probably shouldn’t have tried so hard for me to. This is Man vs. Everest, and even though we might manage to make it up to the top every once in a while, this is not a battle we are ever going to survive. Everest falls short when it’s caring about the puny mettles of men, but it understands that mountain. It will be outlast everything. It always wins. \n\n \nGrade: B \n\n \nGrierson & Leitch is a regular column about the movies.

08c9af8e-b648-4e8d-a1ba-5cda48caa68d	As anyone with a birdfeeder can attest, spring and fall can bring interesting sightings, and with a hint of autumn now in the air, the show has started in my back yard.\n\nThe breeding season is now over, juveniles have long since fledged, male birds exhibit wanderlust and migrating species soon will be on the move.\n\nMy wife has positioned feeders and a birdbath along the side of our house, near low shrubs and a Bradford pear tree. We have cardinals year round, but on Sunday, we had them in particularly high concentration, with as many as 10 visible within a 200-square-foot area.\n\nWe've been fortunate in recent years to have a nesting pair of painted buntings nearby, which frequent our feeders. Lately, we've seen only the female and figured the male had departed for post-breeding dispersal. We had it half right, anyway.\n\nThe adult male has indeed been absent from the feeder, but we noticed that it wasn't two females that continued to feed. Rather, it was one female and two male juveniles that are just now distinguishable at casual glance. This weekend, we noticed for the first time that what we thought was a female was actually a pair of juveniles, which are now transitioning into adult plumage.\n\nThis weekend brought other interesting sights.\n\nI decided to haul out my GoPro, which hadn't been turned on in a while, and position it near a hummingbird feeder. While capturing the video of a feeding ruby-throated hummingbird that is included with this post, I noticed how many other birds had gathered. At one time, I could turn my head 45 degrees and see in my yard cardinals, painted buntings, hummingbirds, tufted titmice, a white-breasted nuthatch, mourning doves, a Carolina wren and a Carolina chickadee. As the buntings flew away, a red-bellied woodpecker and a downy woodpecker flew in to feed on suet. About that time, I heard (but never saw) blue jays in a neighbor's water oaks.\n\nThen a pine warbler -- a species we have not typically seen in our yard until at least October -- plopped down on a feeder.\n\nCan goldfinches and yellow-rumped warblers be far behind?

He’s spent months studying other community hospitals and how they operate independently from their larger, corporate cousins. \n \nKupecz is also one of the key movers behind a plan to add a veterans’ care centre to the hospital. \n \nThe idea has received attention from federal leaders and candidates of all political stripes. \n \nKupecz said veterans have always come back from foreign deployments with health issues largely misunderstood or misdiagnosed. \n \n“It’s encouraging to see the initiatives that have been started in terms of veterans’ care. They are wonderful. To keep emphasizing that, we need to make sure veterans who have health issues get the very best care. And, to my mind, that means making sure they have a secure income and secure support system, with effective programs to get that support when they need it,” he said. \n \nKupecz spent about 14 years outside the country. He is also an Afghan war vet. \n \n“As a veteran I feel it’s important that we contribute to our alliances, as we’ve done with the United Nations in the past, and stepping up to the plate when it comes to international issues. At the same time we need to support refugees and send money to all causes that are helping people around the world. International and aid support is quite important to me,” he said. \n \nRed Shark Men’s Wear has been a fixture in downtown Trenton since 1970. \n \nOwner Shane O’Shaughnessy has seen a lot of other businesses come and go over the decades. He’s also seen the good and the bad when it comes to the economy, but always managed to hang on and make a good living. \n \n“Look at it this way, if the economy was good right now I wouldn’t be having a buy one, get two free sale,” said O’Shaughnessy. \n \nBut O’Shaughnessy does what he has to in order to ride out the downturn, or technical recession as he describes the state of the current economic climate. \n \nThe business owner says it’s time for the federal government to inject more cash into the economy. \n \n“People have to realize the more that’s flipped over is good. Even if that’s tax money.” \n \nBalancing the budget, he said, isn’t the answer, at least not right now. \n \n“Balanced budgets are wonderful if the economy is booming, but the economy hasn’t been booming in a very long time. In a technical recession there’s always the risk of stagnating the economy even more by cutting programs and taking other fiscal measures in order to balance the budget. What we need now is more investment by the government,” said O’Shaughnessy. \n \nA pragmatist, O’Shaughnessy says there’s no easy fix. \n \nLowering tax rates, he said, isn’t always the answer. He says the current tax structure is “fair.” \n \n“What governments need to do is stop being wasteful. It’s not that Canadians don’t mind paying taxes. We all need health care. We need infrastructure. What we don’t need government to do is waste money,” said O’Shaughnessy. \n \nO’Shaughnessy said part of the problem is the current government has hung the economy on the price of oil. \n \n“It’s a wonderful thing if oil prices are rising, but terrible if they’re not. Our dollar is falling. Our economy is falling. We pegged our dollar so high that every other manufacturing job has gone to another country. The U.S. is ramping up. They are doing a lot better than we are. There’s a lot of distrust with the government,” he said. \n \nMost municipal leaders will tell you when it comes to federal spending, cash for infrastructure is always at the top of the list. \n \n“When isn’t it at the top of the list?” said Mayor Jim Harrison. \n \nThe city is in the midst of a massive $70 million overhaul of Trenton’s waste water treatment facility. About $30 million will be spent this year. \n \nThe city has received more than $3 million in funding for the project. \n \n“But we have a long way to go before it’s completed. Any support will be greatly appreciated,” said Harrison. \n \nBut that isn’t the only project. \n \n“We’ve got a lot of underground infrastructure that needs to be replaced. As far as I’m concerned, infrastructure is the number one concern,” said Harrison. \n \nInfrastructure isn’t the only issue in town. \n \n“We want the government to continue the work that’s been done at CFB Trenton,” said Harrison. \n \nHarrison said the major political parties are addressing the infrastructure deficit, the Liberals and Conservative more so. He said the Conservative government has spent a lot of money in Quinte West, and followed that up by saying the Liberals have also committed to infrastructure funding. \n \n“I’ve talked to the candidates to make sure they follow through on their commitments,” he said. “But funding hasn’t gone far enough. We’ll push them to make sure they go beyond the envelope to help make sure our needs are met. All infrastructure is important to us. It helps us grow and makes the city a better, and safer place to live.” \n \nernst.kuglin@sunmedia.ca

The High Court rejected the petitioner’s argument and ordered the police to probe the case under the provisions of Child Marriage Act. (ANI)
a46ee549-8937-445d-a68f-fbcd619ae30f	Costco Customer Experience Example  \nIt was an ordinary work day filled with phone conferences and content creation. Hours spent on the phone and on my computer all focused on teaching companies how to make more money by building better relationships with their customers. \n \nImagine my surprise, no delight, when I opened up an ordinary envelope from Costco in the mail. I could feel that there is a card in the envelope so I figured there was a new membership card enclosed. \n \nInstead, there was a letter with a cash card. \n \nApparently, a shirt that I purchased for my husband for father’s day was in fact not 100% silk as it had been labeled. Costco took the initiative to notify everyone who had purchased this specific shirt and give a $20 cash card for each shirt purchased. They ALSO provided the option to return the shirt as well if we were not satisfied with it. They made sure to include a statement to specify that we were free to keep the cash card even if we decided to return the shirt. \n \nThey apologized and expressed appreciation for our continued loyalty. \n \nThe first words out of my mouth were “I will continue to do business with Costco FOREVER.” This was amazing. \n \nIn a world where companies are quick to hide behind policies, or hide the issue completely, Costco decided to bring it to MY attention and make it BETTER THAN RIGHT before I even knew there was an issue to be concerned about. \n \nThis is an example that we should all try to live up to both professionally and personally. It’s a simple premise really. Just be forthcoming and honest with your customers and they’ll appreciate it. Do it well, and they’ll be loyal to you. \n \nNow, I fully understand that there is likely a backstory that I’m sure involved a lot of rigmarole (yes, that’s how you spell it, I looked it up) and hard decisions. This is an especially notable response to the issue since I don’t remember this shirt costing a full $ 20. But the company made the decision to stand behind their products, found that this one didn’t measure up to what had been advertised, and took more than full responsibility for it. As a consumer, I really do appreciate that. \n \nAs a Customer Experience Expert, I’m so delighted to see large companies setting the example. It truly comes down to the premise I try to live by. \n \nDo the right thing. Always. \n \nHave you experienced anything similar? OR – Have you found that companies HIDE issues and create distrust?

So one night is f**k all really! But I'm rooting for them.'' \n\nDanny also revealed that although his on-screen wife Kellie Bright (Linda Carter) will be busy training for 'Strictly Come Dancing' over the next few months, there will still be plenty of big storylines for the Carter family. \n\nThe 'Football Factory' actor told OK! Online: ''Where do I start? We've got loads coming up. \n\n''New Year's Day is proper! It's all about the Carters.'' \n\nDanny's comments come after 'EastEnders' executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins warned Kellie she could be ''broken'' by her jam-packed schedule. \n\nHe told The Sun newspaper: ''I have lots of material planned for Kellie. Linda's not going to disappear because you can't have the Queen Vic without Linda. \n\n''We gave Kellie a couple of weeks off at the beginning so that she can throw herself into it ['Strictly']. But there's a point later in the run when she's going to be really busy. \n\n''There will be a point where I said to her, 'You are going to be broken'. But we'll just keep watching her, just keeping an eye on her.''

487361e3-7385-4d70-a010-abc0296614f9	A prominent National Rifle Association advocate's 10-minute video suggests the parents of the reporters killed on air not be "emotional" in calling for gun control. \n\nTelevision journalists shot in on-air attack Washington: A prominent National Rifle Association advocate has released a 10-minute video message in which he suggests the parents of the reporters killed on air in Virginia last Wednesday not be "emotional" in calling for gun control.\n\nThe statement was made by Colion​ Noir, who fronts an NRA web video program designed to appeal to young people.\n\n"To the parents of Alison Parker and Adam Ward, I have no right to tell any parent how to grieve for their child," Mr Noir says in the video.\n\n"Grief-inspired advocacy can be extremely effective and powerful and I say run full speed to find the way to end violence like this.\n\n"However, sometimes in a fight we can become so emotional that everyone and everything starts looking like the enemy even when they are there to help us. I am deeply sorry for your loss."\n\nThe video also includes a broadside at Australia's gun laws, with footage of an unnamed man warning that Australia has lost "its freedoms" due to an overreaction to gun violence. US President Barack Obama has previously . So far this video appears to be the most significant response by the NRA to the murder of the two journalists, shot dead live on air by a disgruntled former colleague, who also shot and wounded their interview subject.\n\nOn Sunday Parker's parents appeared on CNN and vowed to fight for increased gun control in her memory.\n\n"Alison would be really mad at me if I didn't take this on," her father Andy Parker said. "And I promise you, these people are messing with the wrong family. We are going to effect a change."\n\nParker's mother, Barbara, said she was not discouraged that other prominent shootings had not yet prompted change, or that those who opposed new gun control measures were so well funded and organised.\n\n"There are people out there whose minds we will never change," she said. "If you are a parent, if you are a mother, if you have children – how can you look your child in the eye and say 'we are willing to allow you to be collateral damage in order to keep what some people perceive to be their constitutional rights'. If we as a society are willing to accept that, what kind of society are we?"\n\nIn a separate interview, Mr Parker said he had already been in contact with other gun control advocates, including Mike Kelly, the astronaut whose wife, congresswoman Gabby Giffords, was shot in the head in a mass shooting, to see how to help push "sensible gun control legislation".\n\nMr Parker authored an opinion piece published on Sunday reiterating that he plans to make his life's work "trying to implement effective and reasonable safeguards against this happening again".\n\nOfficially the NRA's response was silence, though it has used its growing in-house media arm to respond to calls for increased gun control made by, among others, US President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's frontrunner for the next year's presidential election.\n\nHours after the murders, NRA radio personality Cam Edwards, host of a program called Cam & Company, complained the shootings were already being used to promote an anti-gun agenda.\n\n"It has been really disheartening to see in a matter of minutes how this story became politicised," Mr Edwards said.\n\n"This is a community that is absolutely heartbroken right now and you've got people who are trying to turn this tragedy into some sort of political advantage for them[selves]. I just think it's gross."\n\nHe went on to call new gun laws "the wrong response to take here. I think it shows a lack of shared humanity".\n\nMr Noir was even more aggressive in the video.\n\n"Let's face it, the gun issue is nothing less than low hanging fruit for Hillary and the rest of the gun control zealots," he says.\n\n"She can stand on top of the gun control issue, beat her chest and make it sound like she is talking about something, when she is not, and it is getting disrespectful that you think American people are that stupid."\n\nIn an allusion to the controversy over Ms Clinton's use of a personal email server as secretary of state, he adds: "So do me a favour, take all of those useless gun control laws, type them up in a neat little email and then delete them."\n\nOf the man who killed Parker and Mr Ward, he says, "This man's issue wasn't a gun, the same way a morbidly obese person's isn't a spoon or fork."\n\nMr Noir is not an official spokesman for the NRA, but a paid advocate who hosts a YouTube channel with more than 313,000 subscribers.\n\nA self-described "urban gun enthusiast " in his early 30s, he has become one of the most visible faces for an organisation that is usually associated with, as he puts it, "old fat white guys".\n\nMr Noir, whose real name is Collins Idehen, is a native of Houston, Texas, and a practising attorney who earned his law degree from Texas Southern University's Thurgood Marshall School of Law.\n\nHis show – called Noir – is designed to appeal to minorities and young people, two demographics that do not show great support for the NRA.\n\nThe NRA has been contacted for comment.\n\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Twitter Follow FairfaxForeign on

She’s a lady who’s been battered by life and reality TV shows and yet here she is fronting up for another bout. Of course, this time it’s she who’ll be wielding the roses (and forcing her suitors to accompany her on a series of bizarre dates) and the dynamics of that promise to make this intriguing. Tonight is the traditional getting-to-know-you exercise.\n\nThe Block, Nine, 7.30pm \n\nWe know reality TV is all about casting, all about the characters, but few series develop/manipulate their characters with quite the same expertise or finesse as The Block. To its credit, it’s less interested in creating heroes and villains than in showing us the strengths and frailties of everyone involved. Tonight the contestants face their first challenge, during which (a) Scotty proves why he’s not a judge on this show, and (b) various rivalries are played out face to face. There are some splendidly broad moments (including some death stares worthy of Real Housewives). But there is also some delicately handled progression. In one scene, one character displays herself in a genuinely unattractive light. But by the end of the episode we’re suddenly realising just how fragile she actually is, and how close to cracking. It’s a masterly piece of editing.\n\nClothes to Die For, ABC2, 9.20pm \n\nIn style, this British documentary is reminiscent of the many films made in the wake of 9/11 and the London bombings: beautifully-shot to-camera pieces (interspersed with archival footage) that gradually change in mood from the innocent and matter-of-fact to the utterly heartbreaking. And that only seems appropriate, because while the collapse of the clothing factory in Bangladesh’s Rana Plaza that killed almost 1200 people and injured thousands more was not politically motivated, its cultural, social and personal ramifications are very much the same. This thoughtful, unsensational piece lets the facts, and the people affected, tell the story in a way that’s both compelling and thought-provoking. The overarching message is corporate greed inevitably has a profound human cost. \n\nMelinda Houston\n\nPAY TV\n\nLost in Transmission, A&E, 8.30pm\n\nSouthern hipster and Top Gear USA presenter Rutledge Wood has set up a business that helps Americans get old and unusual cars back on the road. The problem is that he usually underquotes and so has to come up with wacky money-making schemes to get the cash he needs to finish the job. Tonight, for instance, he agrees to restore a 1972 Land Cruiser that hasn’t run in 20 years, only to find that it’s a bigger job than he thought. His solution? Spend $5000 on a little old Volkswagen Jetta and a conversion kit that will turn it into a two-door ute. Such a vehicle, he imagines, should sell immediately for $10,000. It’s all fairly entertaining and even a little inspiring. \n\nBrad Newsome\n\nMOVIES\n\nWonderland (2003), SBS2, 10.20pm \n\nIn a 1995 Details magazine profile of Val Kilmer, Bret Easton Ellis wrote, “in movies he has the open-faced, slightly flawed, amiable American beauty that Bruce Weber taps into: a thick-lipped insolence ... a masculinity so effortless it borders on the perverse.” Kilmer was the native Californian who went to Juilliard to study acting and then returned to Hollywood, where for many years he was spoken of as a major star in the making. But the starring roles (The Doors, Batman Forever, The Saint) didn’t match up to the compelling supporting turns (Tombstone, Heat), and early in this century he changed tack, jumping into independent productions such as James Cox’s crime drama about 1981 revenge murders of a Los Angeles crew who had robbed a drug dealer. The central figure was 1970s porn star John Holmes, whose cocaine addiction resulted in multiple bloody betrayals, and Kilmer capably catches the character’s desperation even as the film descends into low-life pungency that never finds a purpose. The same events inspired the firecracker-punctuated drug sting in Boogie Nights, but Cox can’t match a sweating, discombobulated supporting cast, including that master of malice Dylan McDermott, to such coolly inspired filmmaking, and Kilmer’s opportunity is once more lost.\n\nBlood Simple (1984), stan.com.au Critics were divided when Joel and Ethan Coen announced themselves as twentysomething filmmakers more than three decades ago with this Texan-set thriller – “a crude, ghoulish comedy on thriller themes,” wrote Pauline Kael in TheNew Yorker. But looking at the movie now, a neo-noir confection of desire and murder assembled from the stories of James M. Cain and Dashiell Hammett, it’s obvious how self-contained and identifiable the siblings already were. “I know where you can get those framed,” aprivate eye named Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) tells a bar owner, Marty (Dan Hedaya), when he presents him with photos of his wife, Abby (Frances McDormand) in bed with his bartender, Ray (John Getz), and from that staring point nocturnal acts of cruelty take shape not through nefarious schemes but crude assumptions and mistaken identity. These lives are like bitter clockwork designs no one can see, but the difference from latter Coen brothers works is the lack of ironic distance – there’s a rage in Hedaya’s performance that isn’t undercut by the bloody B-movie violence. At one point the camera tracks down the bar top, hopping over the head of a passed-out patron without pause, making for a witty, self-referential arrival.\n\nCraig Mathieson\n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
9662058b-fca5-4771-8058-c7fd7bd548a3	Rick Perry is gone. Scott Walker is gone. It doesn't make a bit of difference. Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee this time around – unless it's Carly Fiorina or Ben Carson. The polls show that – it has come down to the bombastic real estate mogul and reality star, a guy who has never held elective office in life and with no experience in government, and the former CEO who had been fired in 2004 and never worked a day since, with no experience in government, and the retired neurosurgeon who's a little shaky on the Constitution and stuff. These three, combined, have the majority of the party behind them. Jeb Bush is polling at a bit less than five percent, for a reason – prior experience in elected office seems to be a disqualifier now, and everyone knows why. Most Republicans are seething with anger that their party let them down for eight years. Abortion is still legal. Obamacare is still the law of the land. Gays can get married now. Confederate flags came down. We didn't send a half a million troops to the Middle East to get rid of ISIS once and for all. We didn't get rid of Assad in Syria. We haven't stopped Vladimir Putin from doing anything and we're actually talking with the Cubans. And Mexicans are pouring across the border and murdering Americans left and right, and laughing at us. The list goes on and on. No Republican in office stood up and stopped any of this. That's the issue.\n\nThe other issue is noise. Donald Trump is an insult-machine. He specializes in Hispanics and women. Carly Fiorina is an acid-tongued ball-buster. One quip from her and Donald Trump is reduced to a limp stammering schoolboy. Her specialty is emasculation (and with Donald Trump that's a good thing). They go at each other day after day after day – no one can get a word in edgewise.\n\nBen Carson doesn't even try. He doesn't have to. While those two make all the noise, saying one outrageous thing after another, he's the quiet guy who is far more radical than either of them will ever be. That's why he's right up there with these two, while Jeb Bush and all the others have faded into the background. Those who are seething with anger that their party let them down for eight years, or maybe longer, sense this guy will actually blow everything up. Donald and Carly is the sideshow. He's the main event. He'll go where no one else dares.\n\nCarson does skirt the edge:\nBen Carson is changing his position on whether Muslims are fit to be president. After sparking a controversy over the weekend by saying he doesn't think a Muslim should be in the White House, the Republican presidential contender said Tuesday that he is more interested in the president prioritizing the U.S. Constitution over his or her faith. "I don't care what a person's religion beliefs are or religious heritage is," he said at a news conference in Sharonville, Ohio. "If they embrace our Constitution and are willing to place that above their religious beliefs, I have no problem with that."\nThat's a significant shift from Sunday when, during an appearance on "Meet the Press," NBC's Chuck Todd asked Carson, "Do you believe that Islam is consistent with the Constitution?"\n"No, I do not," Carson responded. "I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that."\nBut Carson told an audience in Cedarville, Ohio, he was "asked about who should be allowed to be President of the United States."\n"And I said I think anybody, regardless of their religion, if they are willing to embrace the values and principles of America and our Constitution and subject their beliefs to the Constitution," he said. "I have no problem with that at all. And that's perfectly reasonable."\nThe Washington Post's Chris Cillizza goes to the transcript. That's not how it happened, and Cillizza offers this:\nWhen Carson says he is being misquoted or taken out of context, what he really seems to mean is that the words he used didn't convey the fullness of what he meant. Like, he meant to condemn Sharia law and radical Islam in that interview with Todd. But Todd isn't a mind-reader and shouldn't be. Carson's argument - "Trust me, that's what I meant even if it's not what I said" - is a tough one to swallow without any further proof of his intent.\nRunning for president is hard - especially if you, like Carson, have never run for any office before. You make mistakes; you say one thing and mean another. But, to refuse to acknowledge those mistakes - or at least try to deflect blame before acknowledging them - is the sort of stuff that hurts the political process in the long run.\nOwn up to what you say and/or what you believe. If you make a mistake, say it and explain what you really meant. Looking around for someone to blame is the stuff my six-year old does - and what I scold him for.\nCillizza knows better. Politics doesn't work that way:\nIn a post on Facebook on Monday night, Carson said a Muslim could serve as president if they disavow Sharia law in order to get his support.\n"I could never support a candidate for president of the United States that was Muslim and had not renounced the central (tenet) of Islam: Sharia Law," he wrote. "I know that there are many peaceful Muslims who do not adhere to these beliefs. But until these tenets are fully renounced ... I cannot advocate any Muslim candidate for President."\nHe was back on track and more popular than ever:\nOn Monday, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson was bailed out of the controversy over his views of Islam by an unexpected ally. Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, called a news conference to "ask Mr. Ben Carson to withdraw from the presidential race."\nThe mild disrespect of calling a medical doctor "mister" was apparently unintentional, but the sheer audacity of CAIR's ask lit a fire on the right. CAIR, which plays a role in Islamic controversies similar to the one the Anti-Defamation League plays in Jewish ones, is not viewed that way by elements of the conservative movement. To many, like Center for Security Policy founder Frank Gaffney, it's viewed as a veritable fifth column that may be "engaged in money-laundering foreign funds to pay for civilizational jihad here."\nSo things went well for Carson:\nGaffney and others were reacting to more than Carson's stumbling interview with "Meet the Press" host Chuck Todd. In a subsequent interview with The Hill's Jon Easley, Carson had said that he had been talking not about Islam generally but about sharia law specifically. "Obviously if a Muslim was running for president, there would be a lot more education about sharia, about taqiyya," he said, referring to Islam's term for concealing one's religion in the face of a credible threat. On the "anti-sharia" right, Carson was being railroaded.\n"Let me help out these genius journalists, a.k.a. Democrats, a.k.a. liberals, a.k.a. know-nothings," snarked conservative radio host and author Mark Levin. "There's a difference in Islam that does not apply to Judaism and Christianity and other religions. That is, sharia law is not just a governing law in your personal lives. It is a governing law. That's why in Saudi Arabia, they set up sharia courts."\nAh, Carson was being railroaded. There are votes there, and Slate's Jim Newell notes this:\nCarson's rival candidates sensed that the political novice had committed something in the ballpark of a gaffe. They attacked his position from different angles, many hoping to affix themselves to the outrage du jour to secure more attention for their own presidential efforts. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who has about as much support in the presidential contest as you do, encouraged Carson to apologize to the "American Muslim community" and concluded "that Mr. Carson may be a good doctor, but he is not ready to lead a great nation." Sen. Ted Cruz hardly expressed a love for Islam, but he did note that Carson's approach is at odds with the spirit of the Constitution. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, as usual, submitted the most hilarious take thus far. In an unsolicited statement sent to the press that whines about how the press is always nagging candidates with questions, Jindal explained that he'd be fine with a Muslim president who submits to certain conditions, such as being sworn in on a Bible.\nCarson and his team aren't sweating the modest rebukes from oxygen-deprived competitors.\nNewell says Carson need not worry:\nWhat's the simplest way to put this? The American public is broadly hostile to Islam, and the Republican base is especially hostile. Sure, we've had one GOP presidential candidate overtly defend the "American Muslim community," but that was just Lindsey Graham - and the Republican base is hostile to Lindsey Graham, too. No one else, even the candidates who won't go so far as to affirm Carson's stance, is going to be seen hugging the neighborhood imam anytime soon.\nFor evidence of this hostility: Look around. A Huffington Post/YouGov survey conducted earlier this year found that only 21 percent of the American public has either a very or somewhat favorable opinion of Islam. Fifty-five percent has either a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion. Among Republicans, 13 percent has either a somewhat or very favorable opinion, while 76 percent has either a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion. (As with many surveys, one imagines the thought process here. Muslims, you ask? You bet I view them somewhat unfavorably!) A 2014 Pew survey found that Muslims were viewed even less favorably than the dreaded atheists; an Arab American institute from the same year found that 57 percent of Republicans "doubt that Muslim-Americans or Arab-Americans would be able to perform in a government post without their ethnicity or religion affecting their work." And not affecting their work in a good way, either.\nAnd there's that other factor:\nForty-three percent of Republicans, per the most recent CNN poll, believe President Obama to be a Muslim. That's a lot of people. They believe that the country has already "put a Muslim in the White House," and the experiment didn't turn out very well. President Obama, in their minds, was unable to perform his government job without his religion affecting his work. Why else would he agree to hand Iran nukes or take it easy on ISIS? Why would we ever put another Muslim in the White House?\nCarson simply did what no one else would do, not even Trump or Fiorina:\nPerhaps we should expect more from potential presidential nominees. Well, go ahead and try that; be sure to tell the rest of us how it works out. Carson's response was so obviously in his political self-interest that it only would've been surprising had he responded a different way.\nTrump and Fiorina make all the noise, but Carson, the quiet man, will go places they wouldn't dare go. One shouldn't underestimate how appealing that is to the angry Republican base, and Jamelle Bouie notes how deceptive this is:\nBen Carson's brand is "nice." "Carson has the bedside manner of the physician he is," says the Christian Science Monitor. "Ben Carson doesn't shout," writes Adam C. Smith for the Tampa Bay Times. "He doesn't throw zingers, and he rarely disparages rival presidential candidates. In a period when Donald Trump's bluster dominates the 2016 presidential race, Carson seldom says anything provocative enough to generate TV news coverage."\nThey got it wrong:\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations slammed the retired neurosurgeon, who with Donald Trump leads the Republican presidential pack. "Mr. Carson clearly does not understand or care about the Constitution, which states that 'no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office,'" said the group's national executive director in a statement.\nThe Carson campaign wouldn't budge. "Mr. Carson has great respect for the Muslim community," said spokesman Doug Watts, "but there is a huge gulf between the faith and practice of the Muslim faith, and our Constitution and American values." Despite the reality of the American Muslim community, which is as loyal and patriotic as any group of Americans, Carson - the soft-spoken, genial doctor who runs on his religious faith - believes they are unqualified for high public office and that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with "American values."\nBut this isn't shocking. Of course Carson believes in the disloyalty of American Muslims. His genial reputation conceals a deep commitment to paranoid politics, honed over years of conservative activism and deployed in speeches, op-ed columns, and now a presidential campaign.\nBouie reviews the record:\nAt the Values Voter Summit in 2013, for example, he compared the Affordable Care Act - President Obama's signature health care law - to chattel slavery. "You know Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery," said Carson in his remarks to the conservative gathering. "It is slavery in a way because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care. It was about control."\nThere's no question this is outrageous. But it pales next to the reactionary paranoia of much of his other rhetoric. "I mean, our society is very much like Nazi Germany," he said last year, in a rant against "political correctness." "You know, you had a government using its tools to intimidate the population. We now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe."\nIf political correctness is akin to German fascism, then it's no shock the doctor thinks the IRS is a bona fide secret police. "You know, we live in a Gestapo age, people don't realize it," he said, in reference to the federal tax agency. He believes that President Obama might suspend elections in 2016, that Democrats want immigrants to increase the welfare population and keep themselves in power, and that - as he explained in the first Republican presidential debate this year - Hillary Clinton and "the progressive movement" are "trying to destroy this country" by driving up the national debt and stepping "off the stage as a world leader."\nThis is beyond Trump and Fiorina:\nCarson, the doctor, is a brilliant pediatric neurosurgeon. Carson, the candidate, is a crank - a creature of deep suspicion and conspiratorial thinking, who gives the mainstream a rare glimpse into the American Negative Zone of far-right fear and fetid fever dreams. There, anti-Muslim prejudice is common and unapologetic while Carson's claim - that Islam is inherently anti-American - is axiomatic. Given his political background, his remarks were typical, if not even expected. …\nIf his comments surprised, it's because of his style. Carson's gentle affect is his greatest asset; it soothes listeners and obscures the degree to which he's the most extreme candidate in the race. With that said, he's a Kessel Run away from the Republican nomination. Barring the catastrophic collapse of every other "establishment" or conventional candidate, he has little chance of becoming the GOP nominee, much less president. But that's no consolation.\nThat may not matter:\nRight now, the top candidates in the Republican primary are a nativist demagogue and a right-wing paranoiac. They're channeling and emboldening the worst impulses in American politics, and winning the polls because of it. They will fall, but not before making a dangerous, and potentially enduring, mark on our politics.\nAnd Bouie doesn't even mention Carly Fiorina, the new Queen of Mean. Leona Helmsley step aside. You didn't destroy Hewlett-Packard, lay off tens of thousands of Americans and send their jobs to Asia, and get rich. You went to jail. Carly Fiorina is running for president – but Ben Carson, the quiet man, is the sleeper here. He's not mean – bat-shit crazy maybe, but not mean.\n\nThere's another factor at play here too. Leah Wright Rigueur is an Assistant Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and the author of The Loneliness of the Black Republican: Pragmatic Politics and the Pursuit of Power so she sees this:\nThat an African American that has never held political office is now a front-runner in the Republican primaries has surprised many observers. But his candidacy is perhaps less surprising if you consider two things: the long traditional of black conservatism in America, and how black Republicans like Carson have often appealed to largely white voters. …\nAfrican Americans are no strangers to conservatism. It crops up in the 19th and early 20th centuries, especially among black churches, despite their political radicalism. Conservative thinking was evident even in some of the most progressive civil rights leaders of the 1960s and 1970s. Even today, studies have shown that about a third of black people self-identify as conservative, although their conservatism rarely translates into support for the Republican Party.\nnd this is how we make sense of Ben Carson. He comes from a long conservative tradition, one that is rooted in a belief in religious morality, personal responsibility, self-help, individualism and free-market enterprise, and one that sometimes exists outside the boundaries of partisanship. Some have attributed Carson's switch from ardent Democrat to conservative Republican as a matter of opportunism. That may very well be true, but Carson's book, Gifted Hands, indicates that he has long exhibited the kind of "everyday black conservatism" that defines a portion of black communities. … It's a rhetoric that conservative audiences, almost exclusively white, embrace.\nThen there's the matter of race:\nFor white conservative audiences, Carson is "safe." His words on racism, for instance, while profoundly critical of racist acts, differ sharply from the words of black liberals. For Carson, racism is something to be changed through individual acts rather than something to be eradicated through structural change. Conservative voters can thus look at Carson and have their personal beliefs on race validated, especially because a black man is articulating these same beliefs.\nHe has all his bases covered. Ben Carson, not Donald Trump, may be the man of the moment. You have to watch out for the quiet ones. And yes, they're often dangerously crazy. But that's what the Republicans seem to want this time.
ed17304d-81f1-4329-bc5b-ac381e5223e5	After decades of marriage, we’ve figured out a few things. Here are seven actions that have helped make our marriage work. 1. Put a sock in it. Not in your mate’s mouth — in your own. When you’re annoyed by your spouse, don’t automatically spout off with, “How many times do I have to tell you to ... ?” Give things a chance to cool down. Mostly you will find that ignoring a few unimportant things pays off. You’ve heard the saying, “Don’t make a mountain out of a mole hill.” It applies to a lot of silly situations in marriage. There is nothing to be gained by making a big deal out of something that is simply not worth the fight. Ask yourself, will this even matter tomorrow? Most things won’t. 2. Buck up and take the blame. When you’ve done something stupid or unkind, apologize for it. Be responsible for your mistakes and step forward in a better direction. Only when people acknowledge their part in a problem can change happen. Along with this, be forgiving when your mate apologizes. Holding a grudge in marriage is a catastrophe waiting to happen. Don’t let ill feelings build up. Apologize and forgive. Then hug. 3. Kiss like there’s no tomorrow. Savor those kisses. Keep them coming, daily -- several times a day. Never be too busy to greet each other with a kiss, one that is filled with honeymoon-type passion. This will stoke your romantic fires and keep your hearts warm for all the years of your lives, especially when the words “I love you” are spoken along with those kisses. 4. Work like the devil to stay out of debt. Too much debt is an enemy to marriage. Any debt is a burden. Some experts say there are two purchases that warrant their monthly payments — a house and a car. When you do stick your neck out for these items, make sure to keep it within your budget. Think, what would we do if we lost our jobs? That will help you be wiser in your purchases. Pay these debts off as quickly as possible. For other things you think you can’t live without, save up. Paying cash will save you a ton of interest and make it possible for you to have more of the things your really want and need. 5. Get giddy over making your spouse happy. Think of things you can do that will put a big smile on your honey’s face. You know what she or he likes, so make it happen — often. It doesn’t have to be much. Making the bed in the morning, going for a walk together, getting excited over your mate’s promotion, snuggling the kiddies, helping with their care, noticing how cute your wife looks and telling her, or how handsome he looks and telling him. We all love compliments, especially from the ones we love most. Do everything in your power to help your mate feel those happy feelings. Page 2 of 2 - 6. Be an elephant when it comes to remembering important dates. It’s simple nowadays. All you have to do is program it into your smart phone or computer. Easy peasy. Just do it. Always remember your wedding anniversary and your mate’s birthday. Those are a must. Think about ways to spoil your spouse, even if it's just with one rose, or one package of BBQ ribs. Do something to make the day special for her or him. Make it as nice as your wallet can handle. Think about it beforehand, even plan together in advance for a special date. Looking forward can be as fun as the actual happening. 7. Kick the word divorce out of your vocabulary. When it comes to your relationship, that word is an absolute no-no. You don’t even use it in jest. Make the decision together that your marriage is going to last. Be committed — both of you — verbally to each other. Then stand by that commitment all the days of your life. And not only stand by it, but make it happen by showing respect, loyalty and love for each other in all you do. Then the lasting will be joyful. This is not an all-inclusive list. So many more things can be a blessing to your marriage. Take a minute and list a few of the ones that have helped strengthen your marriage. Then express appreciation to your spouse for doing his or her part in helping your marriage blossom into the beautiful relationship it is becoming.

Bradbury boxer and father of two Davey Browne has died after being knocked out during a bout at Ingleburn RSL Club on Saturday night. Fighting Filipino Carlo Magali for the IBF Pan Pacific Junior-Lightweight title, the 28-year-old was knocked out late in the last round.\n\nWitnesses reportedly said Mr Browne regained consciousness momentarily and was placed on a stool in the corner but slipped off and back into unconsciousness.\n\nHe was taken to the Liverpool ospital and placed on life support but died in on Tuesday morning.\n\nLocal boxer and former world champion Daniel Geale said he knew Mr Browne well and the two had met while they were training at Grange Old School Boxing in Smeaton Grange.\n\nHe said the incident was devestating for Mr Browne, his family and the Macarthur and wider boxing community.\n\n‘‘When I first heard the news, being a boxer myself it was pretty devestating,’’ he said.\n\n‘‘The first thing my wife said to me was ‘are you going to stop boxing now?’ but that wasn’t on my mind.\n\n‘‘But [incidents like these] do knock you for six a bit.\n\n‘‘Davey has always been tall for his weight, a fast boxer and great on his feet.''\n\nTommy Mercuri, a trainer at West Side Boxing in Leppington, first encountered Mr Browne as a 12-year-old.\n\nMr Mercuri had been the hospital to visit the boxer he described as a ‘‘great kid and a great bloke’’.\n\n‘‘He was a beautiful kid all over,’’ he said.\n\n‘‘I trained Davey and his brother Tommy and their dad used to train out of the gym also.\n\n‘‘I can’t say a bad word about any of them.\n\n‘‘This is just a tragedy.’’\n\nEarlier this month the Australian Medical Association — a long time opponent of boxing — called for those aged under 18 to be banned from combat sports.\n\nIt has also pushed for boxing to banned from the Commonwealth and Olympic games.\n\nAssociation president Professor Brian Owler said combat sports were ‘‘inherently dangerous’’.\n\n‘‘As medical practitioners, the AMA is concerned by any sports that involve displays of interpersonal violence, and where the goal is to injure the opponent to the point that they are unable to continue,’’ he said.\n\nMr Mercuri said while the dangers to boxers were not unique..\n\n‘‘People rubbish boxing but it [and incident like this] can happen anywhere — look at Michael Schumacher, motor bike riders and footballers,’’ he said.\n\nMr Geale also called for calm.\n\n‘‘I love the sport of boxing and everyone knows it’s dangerous ... but there are a lot of other sports where people get hurt in a bad way,’’ Mr Geale said.\n\nIt is believed Mr Browne was training out of the Out West Fight Club in Eagle Vale.
172960c6-cb26-4cd1-99a8-d7cb92f8dec8	The organizers of the next Republican presidential debate have announced changes to debate criteria that mean former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina will almost certainly join the rest of the top-tier candidates on the main stage at the Reagan Library on Sept. 16. \n\n"CNN re-evaluated its criteria and decided to add a provision that better reflects the state of the race since the first Republican presidential debate in August," the network announced. "Now, any candidate who ranks in the top 10 in polling between August 6 and September 10 will be included." \n \nThe CNN move is being greeted as a positive development, and not only for the most obvious reason, which is that a woman will be in the mix, in contrast to the 10-man tableau that a huge national television audience saw at the first debate on Aug. 6 in Cleveland. \n\nFiorina also had fairness on her side, say supporters. The original rules would have made the cut according to an average of polls conducted between July 16 and Sept. 10. That arithmetic minimized the significant rise in Fiorina's numbers since she gave what was widely reviewed as the single best performance of the evening in Cleveland, despite being relegated to the earlier, non-prime-time "undercard" debate of longshot contenders. \n  \nNow, Fiorina's presence on the main stage — which, under the new formula, may end up including more than 10 candidates — is likely to make that faceoff a far more interesting debate. \n\n"We are very pleased that CNN changed its mind. We've been hearing from people across the country," said John Heubusch, executive director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation. "They want to see the best debate possible." \n\nIn the enormous Republican field, she is the only one who has demonstrated anything that rivals the thrust-and-parry skills of front-runner Donald Trump — another political outsider who comes from the business world. Trump dominated the main stage in Cleveland, in part because none of his rivals had any idea how to take him on. \n \nThus far, she has demonstrated more finely honed reflexes for the punch and the counter-punch than any of the other Republican candidates, with the exception of Trump. \n\nShe first got the attention of many GOP activists with her sharp, memorable attack lines against the Democratic frontrunner, former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton. Among them: "Like Hillary Clinton, I too have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe. But unlike her, I've actually accomplished something. You see, Mrs. Clinton, flying is not an accomplishment; it is an activity." \n\nIn Cleveland, she may have gotten off the best jab at Trump, even though she wasn't on the stage with him. Referring to a Washington Post report that former president Bill Clinton had called Trump while the New York real estate mogul was considering whether to run, Fiorina said: "I didn't get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race. Did any of you get a phone call from Bill Clinton? I didn't. Maybe it's because I hadn't given money to the foundation or donated to his wife's Senate campaign." \n\nThe other candidates seem to recognize that someone has to take on Trump. That role would seem to be a natural one, for instance, for combative New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. \n\nIn an appearance Monday on NBC's "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," Christie acknowledged that he hadn't lived up to his reputation in the first debate. \n\n"I didn't feel it was appropriate for that night," Christie said. But he added: "Stay tuned — we may be changing tactics." The governor then joked that viewers should be ready for him to "go nuclear now." \n\nOn the trail, former Florida governor Jeb Bush has also gotten more aggressive against Trump lately. \n\n"He personalizes everything," Bush said Tuesday. "If you're not totally in agreement with him, you're an idiot, you're stupid, you have no energy, blah, blah, blah. That's what he does." \n\nBut that is a defensive argument, which drew the equivalent of a shrug by Trump on Twitter: "Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign." \n\nFiorina's past performance — to borrow a phrase from the finance world — is no guarantee of future results. And even her skills may be no match alongside Trump. \n\nShould they get into a tussle at the debate, she can expect Trump to bring up the facts — as he has before — that she was fired from her post at Hewlett-Packard, and that in her only previous run for elective office, Fiorina was trounced by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. \n\nTrump has also tweeted that listening to Carly Fiorina for more than a few minutes brings on "a massive headache. She has zero chance!" \n\nThe debate will be Fiorina's best opportunity yet to show whether Trump is wrong. \n Copyright © 2015, The Baltimore Sun
4a58fe6d-57ca-4191-bfa7-e1dbf7db65c8	“That’s it! it’s not working anymore! We should break-up now”. She said and then sipped the remaining mocha-chino from her cup. He was searching for an answer. They have been through this conversation almost a dozen times. Now he was really tired of this relationship. It’s been 2 years. He had tried a lot to make it work. He has sacrificed a lot. He has crossed all his limits. And he loved her more than anything. A boy loves with all his heart. A girl loves with her brain. A boy will love the girl without knowing her, her family, her tastes, her likes, her dislikes and then try to fit into her image of a good boyfriend/husband. A girl also starts to love without knowing anything, but then rest of the relationship she tries to modify or reshape the boys interest, his style, his likes, his dislike, his passions and even his way of thinking. For a boy it’s, “if you are with me I’ll do anything for you”. But for a girl it’s “if you do this, this and this, for me than I will ‘think’ about you”. A boy will convince his family, his friends and relatives for her. But a girl will not do the same and instead say, how can I. A girl needs a secure future, a stable monthly income, a good house, a good car, a high-profile school for her children. And that too when she is 23 and the boy is 24. She won’t allow the boy some time to earn and settle down. She wants it now and once for all. “Ok”, he said and went up to the billing corner, paid off the bill and left her sitting alone. She knew he will call him after an hour and apologize and say “baby, give me some time, I know it’s my fault, I am looking for a better job and will soon be earning good. And I have talked with my dad we will soon be selling off the land in village and build a home in town, and baby I know you are doing this for us. You just stay with me I’ll do whatever you say.” …………… And the chutzpa (foolishness) continues until she eventually will stop receiving his calls and settle down with a wealthy, good guy. ©fidoic
e7ea7dd7-0266-431a-bfb4-c8e88532c0d4	After four days of intense competition, the Army has named its 2015 Drill Sergeants and AIT Platoon Sergeant of the Year. Staff Sgt. Jacob Miller of Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, is this year's Drill Sergeant of the Year. Staff Sgt. Mark Mercer is the Army Reserve Drill Sergeant of the Year. Mercer is assigned to the 95th Division, 108th Training Command. This year's Advanced Individual Training Platoon Sergeant of the Year is Sgt. 1st Class Samuel Enriquez of Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas. All three soldiers were recognized Thursday evening at an awards ceremony at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Each received the Meritorious Service Medal. The Drill Sergeant and AIT Platoon Sergeant of the Year event is a four-day, "best-of-the-best" contest that puts competitors through physical and mental tests, according to information from the Army. Competitors must battle fatigue, weather and surprise events to earn the coveted titles. They must perform and instruct more than 50 tasks and drills including unknown distance runs and foot marches, rappelling, orienteering, obstacle courses, physical readiness training and appearances before a board of command sergeants major to demonstrate their knowledge of leadership and training tasks. While the Drill Sergeant and AIT Platoon Sergeant competition is similar to other competitions across the Army, this event focuses on competitors' ability to teach, as their day-to-day job requires them to effectively teach the Army's newest soldiers. This year, four active-duty and two Army Reserve drill sergeants competed for the Drill Sergeant of the Year title. Eight AIT platoon sergeants competed this year. All were competition winners at their respective installations or Army Reserve divisions. A closer look at this year's winners: •  Staff Sgt. Jacob Miller As Drill Sergeant of the Year, Miller will be moving to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where he will work at the Center for Initial Military Training. There, he’ll have a chance to provide input and help shape the way the Army trains new soldiers. Miller, 30, joined the Army in November 2006. He completed military police one station unit training at Fort Leonard Wood in April 2007 and has served in MP units at Fort Carson, Colorado, Fort Wainwright, Alaska, and Fort Leonard Wood. Miller, who is working on his bachelor’s degree in criminal justice, has deployed twice to Iraq. His awards and decorations include an Army Commendation Medal with Valor, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, and the Combat Action Badge. Miller, who has been a drill sergeant since March 2013, was in disbelief that he won. “It’s unreal,” he said. ‘It was definitely a long competition, a long week of hard, intense training.” Page 2 of 3 - To prepare for the competition, Miller trained hard, including lots of foot marches, long-distance running and sprints. He also studied up on Army drill and ceremony and all the other tasks soldiers must know. “This competition was very intensive,” Miller said. “Everybody that came here were all winners. Going up against the top of the top here was just unreal.” At the same time, the soldiers shared a common camaraderie, Miller said. “We all came together, we helped each other out, pushed each other,” he said. His advice for those looking ahead to next year’s competition: “Prepare for anything. You need to be fully well rounded when you come here.” •  Staff Sgt. Mark Mercer Mercer joined the Army in July 2002, training as an X-ray technologist. He has served primarily in Oklahoma and has deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Mercer is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma, with a degree in administrative leadership. His awards and decorations include the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. The 31-year-old said he was “relieved, excited” when he learned he had won. “Just so many emotions wrapped up in my body right now,” he said. “I don’t know if I’m in shock still or what’s going on. It shows that hard work pays off.” Mercer started training for the competition in October. In addition to the physical training, Mercer spent three hours every night studying every Army regulation, field manual and publication he could find. “My wife’s glad this is over because we can spend time together now,” he said. “It was very long, strenuous, and I may have trained too hard physically in the end, but I got where I needed to be. Determination and adrenaline go a long way.” Mercer said he’s glad for the experience. “I’ve made some good friends here, met a lot of great people, a lot of knowledgeable people,” he said. “It was an honor to compete against and alongside every single person that was here this week.” • Sgt. 1st Class Samuel Enriquez Enriquez, 30, is a combat medic who joined the Army in August 2002. Before his assignment as an AIT platoon sergeant at Fort Sam Houston, Enriquez served multiple tours with the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and has served in Germany and South Korea. His awards and decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Expert Field Medical Badge, the Senior Parachutist Badge and the Air Assault Badge. Page 3 of 3 - Winning the competition “still seems surreal,” he said. “I’m still soaking it in.” Enriquez, who has been an AIT platoon sergeant since January, also will be moving to the Center for Initial Military Training. “I’m part of something bigger now,” he said. “I’m part of a different level of the Army where I can make huge changes. Before, I loved it, and I could always make change, but it was more incremental. Here I can help make gigantic changes that could shape the future of the Army.” In his new assignment, Enriquez will be responsible for providing input that will shape the initial entry process, whether it’s basic training or AIT. “It’s a pretty grand thing, just thinking about the fact that you’re changing the way the Army trains its soldiers,” he said. “I never thought I’d be in this position.”
